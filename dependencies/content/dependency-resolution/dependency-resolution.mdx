# Dependency Detection and Resolution

Bit's dependency resolution favours consistency and predictability, making sure each time a component is installed

Component dependencies are resolved and determined during component versioning.

Dependencies

```bash
bit tag --all
```

Dependency resolution is handled by the [Dependency Resolver extension](https://bit.dev/teambit/dependencies/dependency-resolver).

Dependency Resolver parses out all `import` \ `require` statements in the component's files.
It then determines if these dependencies are packages, components (listed in the workspace `.bitmap` file) or internal implementation files.

The generated data is integrated with dependency policies that were set by various Bit extensions (mainly,
[Environment](/environments/overview)) and by the manually configured policies set in the [workspace configuration file](/workspace/workspace-json) (`workspace.jsonc`).

The result of that process determines the list of dependencies for each component, as well as their dependency-type (`dependencies`, `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies`) and version number.

## The dependency policies hierarchy

The Dependency Resolver integrates dependency policies from various sources to determine the component's final dependency graph.

Cases of conflicting policies are resolved according to a hierarchy of source types, where the one at the top overrides the rest.

The hierarchy in a descending order:

1. Policies set by Variants (@teambit/variants) and the component.json files of "ejected" components (these two sources are merged by Variants).
2. Policies set by various extensions/aspects (using registerDependencyPolicy)
3. Policies set by the environment (using getDependencies)
4. Bitâ€™s automated dependency detections, and policies set by the Dependency Resolver at the workspace configuration root-level.
