# Dependencies Overview

Dependency management is a major concern for developers looking to build and deliver components independently. It must be done efficiently, to handle an unlimited number of components, each with its own dependency graph.
It must also be done reliably and safely for components to integrate successfully into new and unfamiliar compositions. Furthermore, since Bit introduced a new type of module, the 'component', a proper dependency management must include the handling of these new entities, as well as standard Node packages.

Component dependencies are managed by the Dependency Resolver aspect. It provides component dependency detection and smart dependency resolution that takes into consideration the uniqueness of Bit workspaces and components, and the concerns expressed above.

The dependency resolver generates the component's dependency graph by integrating multiple sources of dependency policies, where some are set manually and some are set by various aspects, programmatically.

Dependency policies are set manually by the component config or by the workspace config. Unlike standard JS projects, a `package.json` is not used to set dependencies. However, if one does exist in the workspace directory, it will also be read by the dependency resolver.

```bash title="Example: dependency configuration (workspace.jsonc)"
// Example: Dependency resolver configuration, including dependency policies.
// ...
"teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/pnpm", // The package manager (aspect) to be used by the dependency-resolver
    "policy": { // The dependency policy for the workspace
      "dependencies": {
        "classnames": "2.3.1", // package
        "@teambit/documenter.ui.copy-box": "4.1.1", // component
      },
      "peerDependencies": {
        "react": "17.0.2",
        "react-dom": "17.0.2"
      }
    },
    "devFilePatterns": [ // glob pattern for dev files (imports to these files are considered as dev dependencies)
      "**/*.spec.ts"
    ],
  },
// ...
```

## Dependency Automation

Bit greatly simplifies component dependency management by automating most of it.
It detects component dependencies, determines their dependency type ('runtime', 'peer', or 'dev'), their module type ('package' or 'component'), and resolves their version number.

Dependency automation enables you to generate dependency graphs for components in the workspace, without manually configuring each component's `package.json`.

## Dependency Policies

Dependency policies define the version and type of dependencies used by components in the workspace. They are set by:

- The component configuration
- Various Aspects (that are used by a component), via the Dependency Resolver API
- The Env (that is used by a component), via the Dependencies Service Handler
- The workspace configuration

Dependency policies are almost never set on a single component, but rather on group of components, selected by some commonality (e.g, a shared Env, a shared namespace, etc.).
This centralized approach makes dependency management efficient, elegant and easy to maintain.

## Immutable Dependencies

Bit makes the consumption of components predictable and consistent. That means, you get the same code on every installation of the same dependency (provided this dependency is a component).

Traditionally, resolution of dependencies is done in installation time, and cached via Lock file (e.g. yarn.lock, package-lock.json) by package managers.

Bit's default, and best practice, is to compute and set dependencies for each version upon [tag](/components/tags) to make sure a component uses the exact version (of components) it needs.

## Dependency Installation

Bit uses the Dependency Resolver aspect to simplify and standardize the process of dependency installation, both in the workspace and in capsules <!--TODO ['capsules'](#) -->, during component build.

For example, when used in the workspace, a single `bit install` command installs all workspace dependencies using your package manager of choice, and imports all components (listed in the `.bitmap` file).
This is true, regardless of the package manager that is being used.

## Dependency Insights

Understanding the relation between components is key to safe and effective component maintenance and collaboration. For that, Bit offers a variety of CLI and UI tools that help in understanding your component dependencies.

It enables you to understand:

- What are a component's dependencies
  - What's their dependency type (runtime, dev, peer)
  - What's their module type (package or independent component)
  - How was a dependency (and its version) determined by Bit
- What are a component's dependents (direct and indirect)

## Dependency Standardization (Envs)

Component dependencies can be configured via an Env to create a single dependency standard for all components using that Env.
For example, an Env can set all components to use `react@16.3.0` as a peer dependency. That way, components will not produce unexpected conflicts when composed together.

## Using a `package.json` for Dependencies

A `package.json` file can be used in your project. When running `bit install` and building the dependency policy, Bit will propagate from `workspace.jsonc` to `package.json`, so all dependencies defined there will be installed as well. You may also decide not to use `bit install` at all. However in this case you lose the ability to define specific dependency policies for sub-sets of components.
