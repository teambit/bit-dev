# External Dependencies

External dependencies are either Components or packages, defined in your Workspace's [Dependency Policy](/dependencies/overview#dependency-policies), installed and resolved 
from the [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directory.

External dependencies configured in your Workspace Dependency Policy are allowed to use from [Workspace Components](/workspace/workspace-component). 

They can be used through the [`bit install`](/dependencies/commands/install) command which uses the configured [Package Manager](/dependencies/package-managers) to install the requested dependency in the [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directory in your [Workspace](/workspace/overview).

```bash
bit install # makes sure your workspace is up to date.
bit install @teambit/base-ui.button # adds @teambit/base-ui.button dependency to the workspace.
```

External dependencies allowed to use in your Workspace can be defined in the [Dependency Policy](/dependencies/overview#dependency-policies) in your
[Workspace configuration](/workspace/workspace-json). `bit install` makes sure all external dependencies are up to date according to the dependency policy defined in the
workspace.

## Package dependencies 
Packages dependencies can be added from the NPM registry or from any other custom registry configured to your `.npmrc` file.

## Component dependencies
Components are installed as regular package dependencies. Bit identifies they are components using the `componentId` property on the component's `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "@teambit/base-ui.button",
  "componentId": "teambit.base-ui/button"
}
```
