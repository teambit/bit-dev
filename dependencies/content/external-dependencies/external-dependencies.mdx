# External Dependencies

External dependencies are Components or packages, defined in your Workspace's [Dependency Policy](/dependencies/overview#dependency-policies), and installed and resolved from the [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directory.

External dependencies are installed in the workspace `node_modules` directory, where they're available to be used by the [Workspace Components](/workspace/workspace-component).

```bash
// Read the dependency policies and install any missing package, accordingly
bit install
```

```bash
// Install @teambit/base-ui.button and add it to the workspaces dependency policy
bit install @teambit/base-ui.button
```

The installation process is done by the package manager configured in the Dependency Resolver. Transitive dependencies (the dependencies of dependencies, and so on) are installed as well.

:::tip
'External dependencies' can be contrasted with 'Internal workspace dependencies'.
Internal dependencies are components that are maintained in the workspace. Their corresponding module is generated in the `node_modules` directory and not installed.
Since they are maintained in the workspace, they can be found listed in the `.bitmap` file.
