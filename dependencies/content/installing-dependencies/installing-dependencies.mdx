# Dependency installation

Bit's dependency resolver ensures Workspace Components and [External Dependencies](/docs/dependencies/) are resolved and kept up to date. It makes sure all components and external 
dependencies are resolved from the [`node_modules`](/docs/dependencies/node_modules) directory.

It fetches [component objects](/docs/components/component-objects) and uses modern package package managers such as pnpm and Yarn to make sure each inepdendent component is resolved with the correct dependencies and their corrosponding versions.
Updating and resolving components and external dependencies in the Workspace is done with `bit install`.


```bash
bit install
```

```bash

```

Dependencies are resolved for each component in the Workspace, according to configuration provided by the Workspace dependency policy, component dependencies or Aspects used by
your components. 
To inspect which dependencies are expected to be resolved for each component, use `bit show` or `bit dependencies` or head over to 
[Inspecting Dependencies](/docs/dependencies/inspecting-dependencies).

## Add an external dependency
Adding an external dependency, which can be either a Component or a package is done by configuring the Workspace [Dependency policy](/docs/dependencies/dependency-policy).
`bit install <component-id>` automate this process by resolving the latest version of the requested dependency, configuring it on the Workspace dependency policy and
eventually make sure the Bit workspace is up to date with `bit install`.

```bash
bit install @teambit/design.ui.buttons.button
```

```
  Resolving component dependencies for workspace: 'docs-examples'
✔ importing components
  installing dependencies in workspace using teambit.dependencies/pnpm
✔ running pre install subscribers
✔ deduping dependencies for installation
Already up-to-date
Progress: resolved 384, reused 380, downloaded 4, added 15, done

dependencies:
+ @teambit/design.ui.buttons.button 1.9.2
  -------------------------
✔ installing dependencies using pnpm
✔ running post install subscribers
✔ linking components
Successfully resolved dependencies for 6 component(s) in 8.815 seconds
```

Since bit install only fetches outdated or unresolved dependencies, the installation process ended by installing the newly added `@teambit/design.ui.buttons.button`.

## Install a specific version of a package
Dependencies can be also added with a specific version. SemVer ranges can also be set on the Workspace [dependency policy](/docs/dependencies/dependency-policy).

```shell
bit use lodash@1.0.0
```

## Updating a specific component or a package

When trying to install a specific package that is already listed in the Dependency Resolver policies, an error will be thrown.  
To override it:

```shell
bit install <package> --update-existing
```

-OR-

```shell
bit install <package> -u
```
