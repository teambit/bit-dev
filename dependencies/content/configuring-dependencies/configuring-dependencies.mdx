# Configuring Dependencies

Even though dependencies are usually set automatically by using [Dependency Policies](/docs/dependencies/dependency-policies), components in the Workspace can be configured with a 
specific set of dependencies. Component dependencies can either be configured with [Variants](/docs/workspace/variants), by the development environment, by ejecting the component configuration, or by editing the [component.json](/docs/components/component-json)
like any [component configuration](/docs/components/component-config) in Bit. 

Specific dependencies can be configured by setting the `dependencies` property in the `teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver` configuration.

In the example below, `classnames` is configured to all components under the `ui` namespace:

```json
{
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "dependencies": {
      "{ui/**}": {
        "standard": {
          "classnames": "1.0.0" 
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To check whether the configuration has applied on selected components run the `bit show` command.

For example: 

```bash
$ bit show ui/heading
```

```bash {6}
┌───────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ id                │ myorg.design/ui/button                                     │
├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ name              │ ui/heading                                                 │
├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ module name       │ @myorg/design.ui.heading                                   │
├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ dependencies      │ classnames@1.0.0- (package)                                │
└───────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Variants can be used to select components by directories, or even to select specific components. To learn more about configuring components with Variants, head over to [Variants](/docs/workspace/variants).

As mentioned, dependencies can also be configured with `component.json` files. These can be ejected for any component in the Workspace with `bit eject-conf`.

For example:

```bash
bit eject conf ui/heading
```

```json
{
  "componentId": {
    "name": "ui/heading",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "scope": "myorg.design"
  },
  "propagate": true,
  "extensions": {
    "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
      "policy": {
        "dependencies": {
          "classnames": "1.0.0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Remove a dependency

Using the `-` sign, components can be forced to ignore a specific dependency. This might be useful in cases where the dependency type has to be changed and in other special cases.
For example, a dependency can be moved from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` by removing it from `dependencies` and listing it under `peerDependencies`.

In the below example, we are telling the dependency resolved to ignore `enzyme` listed under `standard`, but continuing to use the version of `enzyme` listed under `peerDependencies`:

```json title="Removing a dependency and setting it as a peer dependency"
"teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "dependencies": {
      "standard": {
        "enzyme": "-"
      },
      "peerDependencies": {
        "enzyme": "^3.11.0"
      }
    }
}
```

## Dev and peer dependencies
Components can also be configured to use dependencies of different types. Configuring either dev or peer dependencies to a component can be done using the `devDependencies` or `peerDependencies` properties.

In the example below, `@testing-library/react` is configured as a dev dependency: 

```json
{
  "@teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "policy": {
      "devDependencies": {
        "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A component dependency policy will set the type and version of a component's dependency. If that dependency is not already listed in the component's dependency graph (this is usually automatically detected), it will be added.


## Configuring dependencies from an Env
Configuring dependencies from the Env is useful for standardizing component dependencies, such as peer dependencies, across a large set of components. This helps to ensure
consistent and efficient dependency trees. Another example of dependency configuration that might be applied by the Env could be dependencies added during component
compilation.


To set dependencies from a React Env, implement the Env `getDependencies` method and return a set up dependencies.

For example:

```ts
getDependencies(component: any): Promise<DependencyList>
```

Let's take a look at another example. In the code below, we are removing React as a dependency and adding common types packages to all components. 

```ts
import { DependenciesEnv } from '@teambit/envs';

export class MyEnv implements DependenciesEnv {
  // ...

  async getDependencies() {
    return {
      dependencies: {
        react: '-',
      },
      devDependencies: {
        '@types/react': '16.9.43',
        '@types/jest': '~26.0.9',
      },
      peerDependencies: {
        react: '^16.13.1',
        'react-dom': '^16.13.1',
      },
    };
  }
}
```

### Configuring from Aspects

Configuring dependencies from an Aspect can be useful for various automations, improvement of development experience, and more advanced use cases. 

For example: 

```bash
bit create aspect my-aspect
```

Use the dependency resolver aspect as a dependency.

```ts
import { DependencyResolverAspect, DependencyResolverMain } from '@teambit/dependency-resolver';

export class MyAspect {
  static dependencies = [DependencyResolverAspect];
  static provider([depResolver]: [DependencyResolverMain]) {
    dependencyResolver.registerDependenciesPolicies([
      {
        standard: {
          classnames: '1.0.0'
        }
      }
    ]);
    return new MyAspect();
  }
}
...
```

The code example above configures any component configured with the `MyAspect` aspect with the `classnames` package.
