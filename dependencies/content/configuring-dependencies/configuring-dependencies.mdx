# Configuring Dependencies

Even though dependencies are usally set automatically by using [dependency policies](/docs/dependencies/dependency-policies). Components in the Workspace can be configured with a 
specific set of dependencies. Component dependencies can either be configured with [Variants](/docs/workspace/variants), the development environment, from by ejecting the component configuration and editing [component.json](/docs/components/component-json)
like any [component configuration](/docs/components/component-config) in Bit. 

Specific dependencies can be configured by setting `dependencies` property on the `teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver` configuration.

In the example below, `classnames` is configured to all components under the `ui` namespace.

```json
{
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "dependencies": {
      "{ui/**}": {
        "standard": {
          "classnames": "1.0.0" 
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To check whether the configuration has applied on selected components use `bit show`.
```
$ bit show ui/heading
```

```bash {6}
┌───────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ id                │ myorg.design/ui/button                                     │
├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ name              │ ui/heading                                                 │
├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ module name       │ @myorg/design.ui.heading                                   │
├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ dependencies      │ classnames@1.0.0- (package)                                │
└───────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

:::tip
Variants can be used to select components by directories, or even to select specific components. To learn more about configuring components with Variants, head over to the
[Variants documantation](/docs/workspace/variants). 
:::

As mentioned, dependencies can also be configured through `component.json` which can be easily ejected for any component in the Workspace with `bit eject-conf`.

```bash
bit eject conf ui/heading
```

```json
{
  "componentId": {
    "name": "ui/heading",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "scope": "myorg.design"
  },
  "propagate": true,
  "extensions": {
    "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
      "policy": {
        "dependencies": {
          "classnames": "1.0.0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Remove a dependency

Using the `-` sign, components can be forced to ignore a specific dependency. This might be useful in cases where the dependency type has to be changed and in other special cases.
For example, a dependency can be moved from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` by removing it from `dependencies` and listing it under `peerDependencies`.

```json title="Removing a dependency and setting it as a peer dependency"
"teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "dependencies": {
      "standard": {
        "enzyme": "-"
      },
      "peerDependencies": {
        "enzyme": "^3.11.0"
      }
    }
```

## Dev and peer dependencies
Components can be also configured to use dependencies of different types. Configuring either dev or peer dependencies to a component can be done by using the `devDependencies` or `peerDependencies` properties.
In the example below, `@testing-library/react` is configured as a dependency 

```json
{
  "@teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "policy": {
      "devDependencies": {
        "@testing-library/react": "^12.1.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```



A component dependency policy will set the type and version of a component's dependency. If that dependency is not already listed in the component's dependency graph (i.e, if it wasn't automatically detected), it will be added.


## Configuring dependencies from an Env
Configuring dependencies from the Env is useful for standardizing component dependencies, such as peer dependencies across a large set of components. This helps ensure
consistent and efficient dependency trees. Other example for configuration of dependencies that might apply by the env could be dependencies added throughout component
compilation.


To set dependencies from a React env, implement the env `getDependencies` method and return a set up dependencies.
```ts
getDependencies(component: any): Promise<DependencyList>
```

An example env, removing React as a dependency and adding common types packages to all components can be as following. 

```ts
import { DependenciesEnv } from '@teambit/envs';

export class MyEnv implements DependenciesEnv {
  // ...

  async getDependencies() {
    return {
      dependencies: {
        react: '-',
      },
      devDependencies: {
        '@types/react': '16.9.43',
        '@types/jest': '~26.0.9',
      },
      peerDependencies: {
        react: '^16.13.1',
        'react-dom': '^16.13.1',
      },
    };
  }
}
```

### Configuring from Aspects

Configuring dependencies from an Aspect can be useful for various automations, improvement of development experience and more advanced use cases. 

```bash
bit create aspect my-aspect
```

Use the dependency resolver aspect as a dependency.

```ts
import { DependencyResolverAspect, DependencyResolverMain } from '@teambit/dependency-resolver';

export class MyAspect {
  static dependencies = [DependencyResolverAspect];
  static provider([depResolver]: [DependencyResolverMain]) {
    dependencyResolver.registerDependenciesPolicies([
      {
        standard: {
          classnames: '1.0.0'
        }
      }
    ]);
    return new MyAspect();
  }
}
...
```

Snippet above configures any component configured with the `MyAspect` aspect with the `classnames` package. To configure components with this aspect
