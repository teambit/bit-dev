# Yarn

Yarn is an aspect that integrates Yarn **v2** package manager into Bit. This aspect can be used by the Dependency Resolver, for dependency installation.

To start using the yarn aspect as a package manager for your workspace, set the Dependency Resolver `packageManager` property to 'yarn'.

```json
{
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/yarn"
  }
}
```

> Package manager are only configurable at the workspace configuration root-level.
> That means, different components in the same workspace cannot use different package manager.

---

> Packages on NPM will be installed from Bit.dev's registry instead of NPM's. This will be done using the user's Bit credentials.
