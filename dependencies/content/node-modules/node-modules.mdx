# node_modules

The `node_modules` directory is a standard directory in which modules are resolved from, initially by [Node.js Module Resolution](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_node_modules_folders) and as a result by other tools across the JavaScript ecosystem, such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and others.

Package managers take responsibility over the `node_modules` directory for installing external dependencies.

## Installing external dependencies

External dependencies are installed using the `bit install` command, which encapsulates the usage of package managers, such as Yarn and PNPM, making sure component dependencies are deduped correctly and linking all [Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview) Components.

```bash
bit install
```

## Linking Workspace Components

Workspace components are linked through the `node_modules` directory to their location in the Workspace itself for type resolution. `package.json` compiled code is contained under the `dist` directory.

The `bit link` command makes sure all of Bit's core Aspects are linked to your Workspace so that you can leverage Bit's APIs.

```bash
bit link
```

## Delegating node_modules directory to a package manager

Other package managers like `NPM`, `Yarn` and `pnpm` can also be used directly. To use them, configure a `postinstall` in your project's `package.json` file to make sure [Workspace Componnent Link](/workspace/structure/component-links) are generated properly and new Component Objects <!-- TODO [Component Objects](/components/structure/component-objects)  -->are imported.

:::note
We recommend using the `bit install` command for the installation and management of modules in the `node_modules` directory.

```json
{
  "name": "my workspace",
  "scripts": {
    "post-install": "bit import && bit link"
  }
}
```
