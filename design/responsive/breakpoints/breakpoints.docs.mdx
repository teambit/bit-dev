description: A component that provides breakpoint values and specific media query mixins.
labels: ['scss', 'breakpoints', 'media queries']

This component provides a uniform way of using the same breakpoints across apps. It can be used in a few ways.

### Media query mixins

```scss
@use '~@teambit/design.responsive.breakpoints/_breakpoints.module.scss';

@include breakpoints.media-xs {
  ...
}
@include breakpoints.media-sm {
  ...
}
@include breakpoints.media-md {
  ...
}
@include breakpoints.media-l {
  ...
}
@include breakpoints.media-lg {
  ...
}
@include breakpoints.media-xl {
  ...
}
@include breakpoints.media-xxl {
  ...
}
```

This reaolves to regular media queries that use the predefined breakpoints.

```scss

@media screen and max-width: $xs) {
  ...
}
@media screen and max-width: $sm) {
  ...
}
```

### Using breakpoint values as sass variables

Breakpoint sizes can be used directly (not recommended)
```scss
@use '~@teambit/design.responsive.breakpoints/_breakpoints.module.scss';

// notice that we are using the size itself instead of the mixin
@media screen and max-width: $xs) {
  ...
}
@media screen and max-width: $sm) {
  ...
}

```


### Using in js

You can also use the sizes in your `js`/`ts` files. just import the required modules.

```tsx
import { sm, md, l, lg, xl, xxl } '~@teambit/design.responsive.breakpoints';

```
