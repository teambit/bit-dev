          As you start to build with components, remember - choosing the first component is an important step in the
          process. When choosing the first component, focus on choosing the most tangible component, the one you can
          ideally use now. In this case, we start with building the design language showcase. To learn more about apps 
          in Bit you can continue reading the Docs or skip to the Apps section.

          Base Theme is the standard scheme we use across our components - it can include colors, fonts, sizes, etc.
          This component contains a folder of design tokens which can be modified by designers. Developers can then see
          the changes directly in the compositions and use the tokens throughout their components via CSS variables or
          CSS in JS.
          <br />
          <br />
          This allows our independent components to agree on a mutual scheme, which decouples them from a specific
          design language, and allow them to be more flexible and reusable.
