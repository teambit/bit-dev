Welcome to the Bit documentation site! This site is a composition of independent components, built and maintained mainly by the Docs, Design and Community teams here at Bit! It was built from React, Markdown, and Node components we have crafted specifically for the purpose and needs of this app.

## Introduction

across your different projects and keep them up to date.

Below is a sample app demonstrating few design components affected by a theme using design tokens. Click the toggler on the upper right corner to see
the affect of the theme on our components.
