To get the workspace started, run `bit start` and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It may take a while to build the first time you run this command as it is building the User Interface for your development environment.

```bash
bit install
bit start
```

## Start the bit.dev app

Start the [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) app with `bit run`.

```bash
bit run bit-dev
```
