Theme Provider generates a theme out of design tokens (for example: `{ colorText: '#cab854' }`).
Maintaining design tokens in a component makes collaboration between designers and developers easier, and ensures a scalable and consistent design system.

## Basic usage

To create your own theme using the theme provider, fork this demo theme component into your workspace:

```bash
bit fork learnbit.base-react/theme/my-default-theme
```

- Check the [`my-default-theme.ts`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/base-react/theme/my-default-theme/~code/my-default-theme.ts) file (of your newly-created component), to see how to create a new theme using Theme Provider's `createTheme` function.

- Check the [`my-default-theme.compositions.tsx`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/base-react/theme/my-default-theme/~code/my-default-theme.composition.tsx) file, to see how components are styled using the generated theme.
  Notice how the components can be themed using JS variables as well as [CSS props](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

## Extending a theme

Fork this dark-theme component to learn how to customize the previously generated theme:

```bash
bit fork learnbit.base-react/theme/my-dark-theme
```

- Check the [`my-dark-theme.ts`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/base-react/theme/my-dark-theme/~code/my-dark-theme.ts) file to learn how to define new design token values.
  Notice how the `ThemeSchema` type provided by the default theme, is used here to ensure consistency in the way design tokens are used.

- Check the [`my-dark-theme.compositions.tsx`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/base-react/theme/my-dark-theme/~code/my-dark-theme.composition.tsx) file to learn how to theme components using the above overriding design token values.
