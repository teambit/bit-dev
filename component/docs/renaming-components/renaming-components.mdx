# Renaming Components

Use the `rename` command to rename a component or move a component between namespaces and scopes.

```bash
bit rename teambit.base-ui/button teambit.design/button
```

Given that there are potential consumers that use the previous name, Bit does not simply rename the component. Instead, it will create a new component with the new name, and mark the previous one as deprecated.

## Rename a new component

Renaming a new component is simple and only changes the target component ID for your next `export`. Make sure to change depending
`import` statements after renaming your component.

## Rename an existing component

Process for renaming an existing components is performing the following steps:
- Deprecates and references the old component as `renamed` with the target set to the new component.
- Creates a new component pointing to the renamed component to preserve history.
