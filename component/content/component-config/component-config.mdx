# Component Configuration

Component configuration is a composition of different [Aspects](/extending-bit/aspect-overview), where each aspect defines a set of attributes and behaviors.  
These aspects may be an [env](/envs/envs-overview) to define the "kind" of component and different development workflows all the way to controlling dependencies, remote scopes and generated artifacts, etc.  
Configuration is a core part of each [component's anatomy](/components/structure/component-anatomy), making it a part of each component version.

To see the component config head over the component page on a scope or in the workspace dev server, and find the "config" tab. Here you will see the list of applied aspects and their configuration. [Here's an example](https://bit.cloud/teambit/community/ui/graph/bubble-graph/~aspect):

The `show` command, amongst other things, also lists the composed aspects.

```bash
bit show teambit.community/ui/graph/bubble-graph
```

```bash

## Changing component configuration

While configuration is a per-component "thing", Bit offers a set of features to control many components by using configuration rules called [Variants](/workspace/variants) as part of the [workspace configuration](/workspace/workspace-configuration).

With `variants` you can define configuration for a subset of components. In this example, all components with `ui` namespace are configured with the [React env](/frameworks/react/react-overview).

```javascript
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{ui/*}": {
      "teambit.react/react": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Ejecting a component config

If you want to get full manual control over a component configuration, you can have Bit generate a `component.json` file for a component. The `eject-conf` generates the current state of the component config to a file. That file will be at the base directory of the selected components.

```bash
bit eject-conf teambit.community/ui/graph/bubble-graph
```

```javascript
{
  "componentId": {
    "scope": "teambit.community",
    "name": "ui/graph/bubble-graph",
    "version": "1.11.0"
  },
  "propagate": false,
  "extensions": {
    "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
      "policy": {
        "devDependencies": {
          "@teambit/design.embeds.figma": "0.0.6"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once ejected, you can modify it to your liking and control the specific component configuration without interfering with `workspace.jsonc`. For example set dependencies directly with `teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver`, apply another aspect, etc.

:::tip
Set the `propagate` property to `true` if you want the component to be affected by the workspace configurations.

## Diff-ing configuration

The state of component configuration is stored for each version or snapshot of a component. As you modify `workspace.jsonc` or `component.json`, the configuration of a component may change. This triggers Bit to mark the component as **modified**.

Run `diff` to understand which configuration was modified for a component.

```bash
bit diff ui/graph/bubble-graph
```

```bash
--- extensionDependencies 1.11.0 original
+++ extensionDependencies 1.11.0 modified
teambit.community/envs/community-react
- teambit.community/envs/community-react@1.11.0
```

In this example we removed the `teambit.community/envs/community-react` aspect from the component, forcing an configuration diff.  
From here you may decide you want this configuration to be exported. Run `tag` or `snap` to create a new version for the component where the only change is it's config.
