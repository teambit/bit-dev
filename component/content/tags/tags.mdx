# Tags

Tags are immutable component [snapshots](component-objects) that are marked with release versions (`1.0.0`, `1.0.1`). They are used for consumption, as well as for collaboration.

:::note Package Publishing
Component packages configured to be published to a registry other than Bit Cloud (the default), will be published during the tagging process.

```bash
$ bit tag ui/heading
```

```bash
$ bit log ui/heading

tag 0.0.1 (e0121fa8db05451c170b7204c95d14215c8b76b5)
author: Jane <jane@my-company.dev>

```

The tagging process propagates to all dependent components of the components being tagged.
Auto-tagged components will have their patch number incremented `0.0.1 -> 0.0.2`).

```bash
$ bit tag ui/heading

...

3 component(s) tagged
(use "bit export [collection]" to push these components to a remote")
(use "bit untag" to unstage versions)

changed components
(components that got a version bump)
     > ui/heading@0.0.2
       auto-tagged dependents:
            pages/welcome@0.0.2
            ui/card@0.0.2

```

Tags are generated only after the successful execution of the [Build Pipeline and Tag Pipeline](/docs/dev-services/builder/build-pipelines#build-pipelines).
Tagged snapshots include data and artifacts that were generated by these pipelines, in addition to their configuration and source files.

```bash
$ bit tag ui/heading
