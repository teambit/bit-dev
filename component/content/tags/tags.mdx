# Tag version

A _Tag_ is an immutable and exportable component snapshot that is marked with a release version.
The `tag` command runs the component's [build and tag pipelines](./dev-services-overview/builder/build-pipelines) before it creates a new version (that includes the build's generated data and artifacts).
The generated version is stored in the [Local scope](./workspace/local-scope). From there, it can be exported to a [Remote scope](./scope/scope-overview), for further collaboration.

## Tag a component

To tag a single component run the following:

```
bit tag COMPONENT_ID [--ver SEMANTIC_VERSION] [--message TAG_MESSAGE]
```

For example:

```bash
bit tag ui/text --ver 1.0.0 --message "my first version"
```

Once the tag pipeline is completed, the new tag can be seen in the component's changelog, in the UI:

<Image src={firstTag} maxWidth={900} />

To review the component's changelog in the terminal, run the following:

```bash
bit log ui/heading
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```bash
tag 1.0.0 (e0121fa8db05451c170b7204c95d14215c8b76b5)
author: itaymendel <itay@mydomain.com>>
date: 10/27/2021, 5:41:00 AM

      my first version
```

Now that you have a new version,check your workspace status, to verify this component is tagged:

```bash
bit status
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```bash
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > pages/welcome ... ok
     > ui/card ... ok
     > ui/heading ... ok

staged components
(use "bit export <remote_scope> to push these components to a remote scope")

     > ui/text. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
```

## Semantic versioning

Components are tagged with a version number that follows the [semantic versioning specification](https://semver.org/). That allows package managers like npm, yarn or pnpm to install a component as a dependency of a standard project.  
The `tag` command has several features you can use for versioning:

```bash
bit tag --all --major --message "my version message"  # Version all modified and new components with a major version.
bit tag --all --minor --message "my version message"  # Version all modified and new components with a minor version.
bit tag "ui/*" --patch --message "my version message" # Version components matching the pattern with a patch version.
bit tag ui/text --message "my version message"        # Version a specific component with default increment (patch).
```

## Undo a tag

Run the following to undo a Component tag:

```
bit untag COMPONENT_ID TAG_VERSION
```

:::info
`untag` reverts the latest versioning but does not restore changes to files.
:::

For example, `my-org.scope/ui/text` has only one version (`1.0.0`) in the Workspace.
This version has not been exported yet, which means it can be undone:

```
bit untag my-org.scop/ui/heading 1.0.0
```

Since `my-org.scope/ui/heading` has only one version, undoing that versioning restores its status to `new`. This can be validated by running `bit status`:

```
$ bit status

new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > ui/text ... ok

...
```

### Explore a component's version history

To explore a Component's previous versions, use the version dropbox, placed near the top-right corner of the Component's UI.

Each version includes everything that makes a Component such as, its documentation, compositions, configurations, dependencies, and more.

<Image src={componentHistory} maxWidth={800} />

## Auto-tag dependent components

When a component is tagged, Bit automatically tags all its direct and indirect dependent Components.

For example, assume the following component dependency graph:

<BubbleGraph nodes={nodesBeforeTag} />

Since `ui/text` is a dependency of `ui/card`, modifying it should effect `ui/card` as well.
To validate this, we can run a status check to list all components pending to be tagged automatically once these modifications are tagged:

```bash
modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)
(use "bit diff" to compare changes)

     > ui/text ... ok


staged components
(use "bit export to push these components to a remote scope")

     > ui/card. versions: 0.0.1 ... ok
     > ui/heading. versions: 0.0.1 ... ok
     > ui/text. versions: 0.0.1 ... ok


components pending to be tagged automatically (when their dependencies are tagged)
     > ui/card ... ok
```

Then, tag `ui/text`:

```bash
bit tag ui/text
```

We should get an output similar to the following:

```bash
2 component(s) tagged
(use "bit export [collection]" to push these components to a remote")
(use "bit untag" to unstage versions)

changed components
(components that got a version bump)
     > ui/text@0.0.2
       auto-tagged dependents:
            ui/card@0.0.2
```

<BubbleGraph nodes={nodesAfterTag} />

Note that the new version of an auto-tagged component always get a path bump, regardless of the version number increment of the component being explicitly tagged.

### Skip auto-tag

You may skip the auto-tag behavior for a component by using the `--skip-auto-tag` flag:

```bash
bit tag ui/heading --message "my version message" --skip-auto-tag
```
