# Component Tags

You can tag a specific state of a component as being a release. Bit calls these annotations **Tags**, and use semantic versioning for marking these releases. A tag is immutable, making it safe for consumers to depend on.  
There are additional attributes that make Tags work best for consumers, we'll go over them in this section.

:::info Similarities with `snap`

Versioning components uses much of the same internal mechanism as `snap` in regards to how they are stored. This doc may be similar to `snap`'s documentation.

:::

## Versioning a Component

To showcase how tagging work, create a new workspace and add your first component.  
For this demo we'll use a basic demo project, as it has a few components to start with.

```bash
bit new react tag-demo
cd tag-demo
```

All components in this project are new, so none of them has any versions.  
To record our first version we use the `tag` command:

```bash
bit tag ui/text --ver 1.0.0 --message "my first vesion"
```

During the `snap` process, Bit runs the full component [build pipeline](/docs/dev-services/builder/build-pipelines#build-pipelines), as defined in its environment.  
We can see the new version in the component's **changelog** tab in the workspace-ui:

<img src={firstTag} />

```bash
$ bit log ui/heading

tag 1.0.0 (e0121fa8db05451c170b7204c95d14215c8b76b5)
author: Jane <jane@my-company.dev>
date: 10/27/2021, 5:41:00 AM

      my first version
```

Now that you have a new version, you can also run `status` to see that the component is tagged:

```bash
bit status
```

```bash
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > pages/welcome ... ok
     > ui/card ... ok
     > ui/heading ... ok
                         
staged components
(use "bit export <remote_scope> to push these components to a remote scope")

     > ui/text. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
```

:::info Tags and Snapshots

Bit uses snapshots to record the state of a component and creates a unique type of pointer using the semantiv version selected to mark a snapshot as a release.  
The result of this is a similar structure to how Bit stores snapshots.  

<img src={tagSnap} />

As this is an automated flow where you don't need to run `snap` before you `tag`, for the remainder of this doc, we'll only show `tag` in the graphs.  
Read more on snapshots [here](/docs/components/snaps).

### Semantic Versioning

Bit adheres to Semantic Versioning as defined by [SemVer](https://semver.org/) when versioning components. This way any package manager like npm, yarn or pnpm can consume the comopnent as a dependency to a project.  
The `tag` command has several features you can use for versioning:

```bash
bit tag --all --major --message "my version message"  # Version all modified and new components with a major version.
bit tag --all --minor --message "my version message"  # Version all modified and new components with a minor version.
bit tag "ui/*" --patch --message "my version message" # Version components matching the pattern with a patch vesion.
bit tag ui/text --message "my version message"        # Version a specific component with default increment (patch).
```

## Exporting Tags

To allow consumers to use a version of a component we first must tag is with a version. They we can export tag using `export` command:

```bash
bit export
```

:::note When self-hosting bit

If you are self-hosting Bit, the process of publishing a component to a registry happens as part of the `bit tag` process, not `bit export`.  
When using bit.cloud, consumption happens directly from a remote Scope, so `tag` does not need to publish to a registry.

:::

## Tagging New Versions

As components are not only built from source code, there are various things that Bit considers as "changes" for a component:

- Modification in any of the component files.
- New file added.
- File removed.
- Dependenty version update.
- Configuration changed.

Change any of the files in `demo/ui/text`, and then run `tag` again:

```bash
bit tag ui/text --message "my version message"
```

When we run `bit log` for `ui/text` again, we see the updated revision history:

```
tag 1.0.1 (e0121fa8db05451c170b7204c95d14215c8b76b5)
author: Jane <jane@my-company.dev>
date: 10/27/2021, 6:41:00 AM

      my version message

tag 1.0.0 (e0121fa8db05451c170b7204c95d14215c8b76b5)
author: Jane <jane@my-company.dev>
date: 10/27/2021, 5:41:00 AM

      my first version
```

:::info Version History

Bit creates a new tag for the component with the new changes and adds a new pointer with the new semantic version:

<img src={twoTags}  style={{ maxHeight:'200px' }} />

Version history and presedence is determined by semantic verion, not when a tag was created.

:::

### Explore the Version History

Bit keeps a visual representation of the version history of a component. Run either the local dev-server:

```bash
bit start
```

In each component's **changelog** tag you can see all past versions and choose to explore each of them.

## Automated Dependent Versioning

When a component is tagged, Bit automatically version all the components that depend on it. Auto-tagged components will have their patch number incremented `0.0.1 -> 0.0.2`).
