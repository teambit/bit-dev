# Capsule

A capsule is an isolated component environment. It is mainly implemented as a directory that hosts a component outside its workspace directory.

Capsules provide a context-free setting for component build tasks. They play an essential role in validating that a component is truly decoupled from its workspace, and will be able to function properly in other host projects.

For example, a component that does not hove 'module-a' in its dependency graph, but needs it in order to function, may be able to function in its workspace (provided the module was installed in the workspace), but will fail to function in a Capsule, where packages are only installed for that specific component.

```bash title="Example: component-a is coupled to the workspace"
.
├── page
    └── node_modules
        └── module-a # installed due to 'component-a'
    └── scope
        └── component-a # has module-a in its dependency graph
        └── component-b # does not have module-a in ist dependency graph although it does need it
```

## Capsule directory structure

Capsules are located in Bit's `capsules` directory:

- macOS: `~/Library/Caches/Bit/capsules/`

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bit\capsules\`

To change the location of that directory (globally):

```bash
bit config set capsules_root_base_dir "my-new-path"
```

Component capsules are generated for each build inside a common directory that corresponds to the workspace that executed that build. That common directory is named with a hash based on the absolute path of the corresponding workspace. It may also include assets shared by components of the same Env (for example, the preview bundles).

For example:

```
├── /Users/eden/Library/Caches/Bit/capsules/f170673b3ef2c76c19d7c6ca9e37decddac38e6d
    ├── company.scope_envs
        └── my-react@0.0.1-preview         # preview assets for Env 'envs/my-react'
    ├── company.scope_envs_my-react@0.0.1  # component capsule
    ├── company.scope_ui_heading@0.0.1     # component capsule
    └── company.scope_ui_text@0.0.1        # component capsule
```

:::note Capsules are temporary
Each build starts by removing the capsule that was previously generated for the same workspace.

## Network

A network is a group of capsules that are linked by their dependencies. A network includes a graph of all seed components given to it, as well as a list of all capsules.

- 'Seeders': Components that where explicitly built (e.g, bit build <components)>).

- 'Graph capsules' Seeders and their dependencies
