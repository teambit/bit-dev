# Component Overview

**Bit Component** is a container designed for single module or component, it allow you to decouple and version independent components.  
It is the most fundamental building block of Bit and what enables component-driven software. Create, maintain and compose components to apps and systems.

Each component has a unique [ID](/components/component-id) and contains [Source Code](/components/source-code), [Dependencies](/dependencies/overview), [Artifacts](/components/artifact), [Configuration](/components/component-config) and [Metadata](/components/metadata). Component generates and manages its own artifacts, like [Package](/packages/package), [Distribution](/compiler/dist), and even a [Preview](/preview/preview).

Components are connected through dependencies have their own unique version history.

[Workspaces](/docs/workspace/workspace-overview) is where components are developed. You can [snap](/docs/components/snaps) a component to save changes for component, or [tag](/docs/components/tags) and use semver to version a set of changes. Bit persists these changes to builds the component history, and stores it for the workspace. Using [import](/docs/components/importing-components) and [export](/docs/components/exporting-components) to sync these changes to a remote scope.

The following steps walk you through a basic component synchronization workflow.  
Start with `import`ing a component to a Bit workspace:

```bash
bit import teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview
```

```bash
successfully imported one component
- up to date teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview   
```

Import fetches a component and it's complete history from a remote scope to your workspace.  
Use `list` to check which components are available in the workspace and get their current version.

```bash
bit list
```

```bash
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────────────┐
│ component ID                             │ latest in scope │ used in workspace │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────────┤
│ teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview │ 0.0.3           │ 0.0.3             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

You can apply changes to any component in your workspace and run `status` to see that Bit recognizes it.

```bash
bit status
```

```bash
modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)
(use "bit diff" to compare changes)

     > content/aspects-overview ... ok
```

As the previous version of the component is logged as part of the component, use `diff` to see the modifications.

```bash
bit diff teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview
```

```bash
------------------------------------------------------------------
showing diff for teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview
------------------------------------------------------------------
--- aspects-overview.mdx (0.0.3 original)
+++ aspects-overview.mdx (0.0.3 modified)
@@ -56,7 +56,6 @@ export class MyOtherAspect {
 
...
```

After reviewing your changes, version the component using either `bit tag` or `bit snap`.

```bash
bit tag --all 10.0.0 --message "my own version"
```

```bash
1 component(s) tagged
(use "bit export [collection]" to push these components to a remote")
(use "bit untag" to unstage versions)

changed components
(components that got a version bump)
     > teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview@1.0.0
```

Local versions can be exported and synced back to the remote scope with the `export` command.

```bash
bit export
```

```bash
exported the following 1 component(s):
teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview
```

When a new version is synced to the scope, other workspaces may sync themselves with all remote changes. Using `import` with no other options tells Bit to update all components in the workspace.

```bash
bit import
```

```bash
- updated teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview new versions: 1.0.0  
```

Now that you have the latest changes synced, use `checkout` to show them in your workspace.

```bash
bit checkout latest --all
```

```bash
successfully switched the following components to their latest version

teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview@1.0.0
    updated aspect-graph.ts 
    updated aspects-overview.composition.tsx 
    updated aspects-overview.docs.mdx 
    auto-merged aspects-overview.mdx 
    updated composability.png 
    updated index.ts 
```
