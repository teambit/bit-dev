# Component Overview

`Component` is a decoupled, versioned source-code container designed for the purpose of containing a single module or component. 
It is the most fundamental building block of Bit and what unlocks component-driven software, where independent components are defined, implmented and composed into systems.

Each Component has a [Component ID](/components/component-id) and contains [Source Code](/components/source-code), [Dependencies](/dependencies/overview), [Artifacts](/components/artifact), [Configuration](/components/component-config) and [Metadata](/components/metadata). 
Common artifacts for a Component could be either a [Package](/packages/package), [Distribution](/compiler/dist) or a component [Preview](/preview/preview).
Components are developed, edited and versioned from Workspaces, where Scopes act as a component collaboration server.

Component are versioned using [Tag](/component/tag), which sets a SemVer, [Snap](/component/snap) verions component with an hash (similiar to a git commit). [Lanes](/component/lanes) allow diverging
history and version proposed changes to a set of components.
Upon every `tag` or `snap` a new object is persisted to the Scope. Operations like [Import](/workspace/import) and [Export](/workspace/export) are used to synchronize changes with a remote
scope between any number of workspaces.

```bash
$ bit import
```

```bash
successfully imported one component
- up to date teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview   
```

importing a component fetchs the latest changes from the remote scope and syncs them with the workspace's local scope. In this case, our component is up to date.

For viewing the component history log use `bit log`.
```bash
$ bit log
```

`bit log` shows all versions created for the component across all worksapces. You can check the current version of the component in the Workspace with `bit list`.

```bash
$ bit list
```
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────────────┐
│ component ID                             │ latest in scope │ used in workspace │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────────┤
│ teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview │ 0.0.3           │ 0.0.3             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

Versioning a component usaully happens after applying changes to a component. Check for the component status using `bit status`.

```bash
$ bit status
```

```
modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)
(use "bit diff" to compare changes)

     > content/aspects-overview ... ok
```

We can see the component got modified, diffing the changes from the previous version is possible `bit diff`.

```
$ bit diff
```

```

 Aspects are extensible by design. Every aspect can expose an API for other aspects to use in order to extend it using [Integration Slots](/extending-bit/slots).
```

After reviewing our changes, we can version the component using either `bit tag` or `bit snap`. The example below, versions all new and modified components with version 1.0.0.

```bash
$ bit tag --all 1.0.0
```

```
1 component(s) tagged
(use "bit export [collection]" to push these components to a remote")
(use "bit untag" to unstage versions)

changed components
(components that got a version bump)
     > teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview@1.0.0
```

After versioning a component, syncing changes to the remote scope can be done with `bit export`.

```
$ bit export
```

```
exported the following 1 component(s):
teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview
```

Using `bit import` from a different workspace, which also consists of this component imported, would end up with a new version update.

```bash
$ bit import
```

```bash
- updated teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview new versions: 1.0.0  
```

Once the component got updated, you can checkout to either the new version, or any other version of the component. In the below example, I'm checking out all component
in my workspace to the their `HEAD`.

```bash
$ bit checkout latest --all
```

```
successfully switched the following components to their latest version

teambit.harmony/content/aspects-overview@1.0.0
	updated aspect-graph.ts 
	updated aspects-overview.composition.tsx 
	updated aspects-overview.docs.mdx 
	auto-merged aspects-overview.mdx
