# Navigate Component History

When you have created several component snapshots or versions, or you imported a component with an existing history, you may want to navigate the history of the component and see how it evolved.  
Bit offers several tools for both viewing the history, understanding differences and even take your component back in time to a past version.

Bit keeps the component history as an attribute of each component. This provides some unique capabilities when using Bit in your codebase:

- Independent view of the history of each component.
- Bring the complete history of a component to other workspaces (when using `bit import`).
- Checkout past versions of a component in a workspace.
- Track new changes to the component history in any workspace.

This de-centralized approach to component history is a key feature of Bit and allows for more autonomy for developers.

## Viewing the History for Remote Components

The scope-server allows complete autonomy for a viewer to explore past versions of a component. You may use the [component **changelog** tab](https://bit.dev/teambit/community/ui/graph/bubble-graph/~changelog).

<Image src={scopeChangelog} width="80%" />

This tab shows you the complete history of a component with all log messages. Clicking on each version takes you back in time to that version. You can see the component's implementation, documentation, tests, configuration and rendering.  
Another option is to use the version selector drop down:

<Image src={versionDropdown} width="40%" />

You may also use your CLI to view the history of a remote component:

```bash
bit log teambit.community/ui/graph/bubble-graph --remote
```

```bash
...

## Viewing the History for Local Components

:::info follow along

To follow this section start a new project and import the [bubble graph](https://bit.dev/teambit/community/ui/graph/bubble-graph) component.  
All commands and examples will use it as a reference. If you have your own component with history, you may use it.

```bash
mkdir navigate-history && cd navigate-history
bit init
bit import teambit.community/ui/graph/bubble-graph
```

:::

Any component you import or create in the workspace will have all its history information available in the local dev server:

```bash
bit start
```

You can run `log` to view the history as well:

```bash
bit log teambit.community/ui/graph/bubble-graph
```

## Get Diff Between Versions

For your local components, you may use `diff` command to see how component versions evolved:

```bash
bit diff teambit.community/ui/graph/bubble-graph 1.8.15
```

The diff output contains implementation change, dependency updates and configuration between versions.

```bash

## Checkout to a Specific Version

You can have Bit revert a component to a past history state with the `checkout` command:

```bash
bit checkout 1.8.15 teambit.community/ui/graph/bubble-graph
```

The contents of the component directory will be updated to the version you specified and Bit will install the dependencies of the component according to the past version.

```bash
...

```

To move back to the latest version, use the `checkout latest` command:

```bash
bit checkout latest teambit.community/ui/graph/bubble-graph
```

### Checkout Many Components

The `checkout` command supports multiple components at once, so you can revert trees of components.

```bash
bit checkout <version> [ids...] # checkout the specified ids (or all components when --all is used) to the specified version
bit checkout latest [ids...]    # checkout the specified ids (or all components when --all is used) to their latest versions
bit checkout [ids...] --reset   # remove local modifications from the specified ids (or all components when --all is used)
```

you can use a pattern for multiple ids, such as bit checkout 0.0.1 "utils/*". (wrap the pattern with quotes to avoid collision with shell commands)
