# component.json

The `component.json` file enables you to set component configurations directly on a component. The `component.json` configuration is merged with the configurations set by Variants.

To eject it to the component's directory, run:

```bash
bit eject-conf <component-full-name>
```

For example:

```bash
bit eject-conf ui/text
```

The ejected file will contain the following:

```json
{
  "componentId": {
    "name": "ui/text",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "scope": "company.scope"
  },
  "propagate": false,
  "extensions": {}
}
```

## propagate

Set the `propagate` property to `true` if you want the component to be affected by the workspace configurations.

## extensions

Use the `extensions` property to configure Aspects. Configuration is done similarly to the workspace configuration file (`workspace.jsonc`).

For example, to set a dependency policy using the Dependency Resolver Aspect:

```json
{
  "componentId": {
    "name": "ui/text",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "scope": "company.scope"
  },
  "propagate": true,
  "extensions": {
    "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
      "policy": {
        "dependencies": {
          "lodash": "^14.17.21"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
