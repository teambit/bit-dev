# Snaps

Snaps are immutable component [snapshots](component-objects) that are referenced only by their hash (and not by a semantic release version).

Snaps are used for component collaboration, and not for consumption.

```bash
$ bit snap ui/heading
```

```bash
$ bit log ui/heading

snap 230805edf5fc9fda6701777ffae892df94f68a72

```

The snapping process propagates to all dependent components of the components being snapped.

```bash
$ bit snap ui/heading

...

3 component(s) snapped
(use "bit export [collection]" to push these components to a remote")
(use "bit untag" to unstage versions)

changed components
(components that got a version bump)
     > ui/heading@30a05c3ffaa0cb98d196f4e6e723edf12b430cac

       auto-snapped dependents:
       pages/welcome@4259cec3fb31b0e5c8a7c1cab82504d1e08f2967,
       ui/card@b0b69987ac52394c5b04b7c01b8f3325738c4f82

```

Tags are generated only after the successful execution of the [Build Pipeline and Snap Pipeline](/docs/dev-services/builder/build-pipelines#build-pipelines).
Tagged snapshots include data and artifacts that were generated by these pipelines, in addition to their configuration and source files.

```bash
$ bit tag ui/heading
