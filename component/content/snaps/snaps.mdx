# Snap version

:::note Missing UI Capabilities
Snaps are safe to use. However, Snaps are not represented well in the UI.  
This feature is still under development.
:::

A Snap is an immutable and exportable component version that is marked and referenced using a hash (`2ec9427...`).
Snaps are used for component collaboration - not for consumption. A snap has no semantic version to communicate how to use it safely,
and has no corresponding published package.

The snap command runs the component's [build and snap pipelines](./dev-services/builder/build-pipelines) before it creates a new version (that includes the build's generated data and artifacts).
The generated version is stored in the [Local scope](./workspace/local-scope). From there, it can be exported to a [Remote scope](./scope/scope-overview), for further collaboration.

## Snap a Component

To snap a single component run the following:

```
bit snap COMPONENT_ID [--message SNAP_MESSAGE]
```

For example:

```bash
bit snap company.scope/ui/text --message "a demo snapshot"
```

Once the snap pipeline is completed, the new snap can be seen in the component's changelog, in the UI:

<Image src={firstSnapHistory} maxWidth={900} />

To review the Component's changelog in the terminal, use the `bit log` command. For example:

```bash
$ bit log my-org.scope/ui/text

snap 2ec9427e94b56bd3ed886b7eea42e84563001f5d
author: john <john@mydomain.com>
date: 11/14/2021, 12:25:52 PM

      a demo snapshot
```

## Snap a dependent Component

A component may depend on other components.
When that happens, the latest snap version of a dependent component will reference the latest snap version of the component it depends on.

For example, the following command snaps `my-org.scope/ui/heading`, which is depends on `my-org.scope/ui/text`:

```
$ bit snap my-org.scope/ui/heading

...
1 component(s) snapped
(use "bit export" to push these components to a remote")
(use "bit untag" to unstage versions)

new components
(first version for components)
     > ui/heading@c8aa8acf00c855560443e5be9b8142c70a04c8b8
```

When the latest snap of `my-org.scope/ui/heading` is examined using `bit show`, it shows the latest snap version of `my-org.scope/ui/text` (`2ec9427e94b56bd3ed886b7eea42e84563001f5d`) as a dependency.

```
$ bit show my-org.scope/ui/heading@c8aa8acf00c855560443e5be9b8142c70a04c8b8

## Undo a snap

Run the following to undo a Component snap:

```
bit untag COMPONENT_ID SNAP_VERSION
```

:::info
`untag` reverts the latest versioning but does not restore changes to files.
:::

For example, `my-org.scop/ui/heading` has only one version `c8aa8acf00c855560443e5be9b8142c70a04c8b8` in the Workspace.
This version has not been exported yet, which means it can be undone:

```
bit untag company.scop/ui/heading c8aa8acf00c855560443e5be9b8142c70a04c8b8
```

Since `my-org.scop/ui/heading` has only one version, undoing that versioning restores its status to `new`. This can be validated by running `bit status`:

```
$ bit status

new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > ui/heading ... ok


snapped components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" or "bit tag --snapped [version]" to lock a version)

     > ui/text ... ok

...
```

## Snapshot all modified Components

Use the `--all` flags to snap all modified Components in the Workspace. Dependent Components will reference, in their dependency graph, the new snap versions of their dependencies.

```bash
bit snap --all --message "update several components"
```

A versioned Component (either snapped or tagged) can be versioned again only if it has been modified since its last version.

A Component is considered modified if one or more of the following is true:

- One of its source files has been changed
- A file has been added to it, or removed
- Its dependency graph has been changed
- Its Component configuration has been changed

### Auto-snap dependents

Use the `--auto-snap-dependents` option to snap a Component, as well as every direct and indirect dependent Component of it.

```bash
bit snap ui/heading --message "update my heading" --auto-snap-dependents
```
