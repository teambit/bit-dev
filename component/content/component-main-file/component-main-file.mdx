# Main File

A component's _main file_ exposes an API for other components to use. It makes the component's code more maintainable and comprehensible by providing a single entry point.

A `main` file will typically look like this, but may contain additional exports as needed:

```ts
export { Button } from './button';
export type { ButtonProps } from './button';
```

A component's main file is determined by one of the following (ordered by descending importance):

1. A manually set `main` file when running `bit add` command with the `--main` option.
1. A component's `index.ts` or `index.js`.
1. File with the same name as the component's directory name (e.g, `button/button.ts`).

Bit registers the main file in the `.bitmap` file of your workspace. For example:

```json
{
  "inputs/button": {
    "scope": "teambit.base-ui",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "mainFile": "index.ts",
    "rootDir": "base-ui/inputs/button"
  }
}
```

:::info The package.json main property
Your compiler uses the component's `mainFile` property to determine the main property of the `package.json` (the path to the compiled main file.)
for example, `main: 'dist/{main}.js'`. To learn more about configuring the component's `package.json` see [Managing the package.json](./packages/managing-package-json).

## Changing a Component main file

To change a Component's main file, run the following:

```bash
bit add COMPONENT_DIRECTORY_PATH --id COMPONENT_ID --main FILE_PATH
```

For example, the following changes the main file of `company.scope/ui/text` to `text.tsx`:

```
$ bit add demo/ui/text --id ui/text --main text.tsx
```
