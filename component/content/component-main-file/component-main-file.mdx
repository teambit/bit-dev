Component's `main` file is a a way to rollup exports from the component in a single convenient method. It exposes selected exports of from the component, similar to a [barrel file](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/barrel).  
This practice simplifies the component's code and allows for easier maintenance, as it is a single point of entry for the component.

A `main` file will typically look like this, but may contain additional exports as needed:

```ts
export { Button } from './button';
export type { ButtonProps } from './button';
```

There are several rules Bit follows when setting a `main` file (list is orered by importance):

1. Manually set `main` file when running `bit add` command with the `--main` option.
1. `index.ts` or `index.js`.
1. File with the same name as the component's foldername.

Bit logs the `main` file in the `.bitmap` file, and uses it when generating the component's `package.json` fil
