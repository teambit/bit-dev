# Main File

The main file of a Component is the file resolved upon a `require` of the Component Directory. Main file is usually expected to expose the Component API.
It is set upon tacking or creation of a Component using and defined in the `.bitmap` file.

## index files

By default, an `index.ts` or an `index.js` file isÂ considered to be the main file of a [Component](/components/overview).
It is recommended to expose all APIs expected to be used by the [Component](/components/overview) consumers from the Component main file. Here is an example for a simple `index.ts` file of a `Button` component.

```ts
export { Button } from './button';
export type { ButtonProps } from './button';
```

### Requiring internal files of components

Requiring internal files of components is highly not recommended and might cause inconsistencies due to compiling of the Component. If requiring an internal file makes sure to only `require` files which are not compiled by the [Component](/components/overview) defined [Compiler](/compiler/overview) like `scss`, `less` or `png` files.

```ts
import { Button } from '@teambit/base-ui.button'; // good!
import { Button } from '@teambit/base-ui.button/button'; // bad! requires internal file of the component.
import styles from '@teambit/base-ui.button/button.modules.scss'; // resources like `scss` and `png` since they are not compiled and handles by the consuming app.
```

## Main file resolution

By default, Bit resolves `index.ts` or `index.js` to be the main file of the Component if one of them exists. Otherwise, Bit looks for a file corresponding to the [Component Name](/components/component-id#component-name). In a case a main file is defined through the `--main` flag, Bit will look for this file alone.

## Changing a Component main file

Changing a main file can be achieved by the `bit add` command. Use `bit add` on the desired [Component ID](/components/id) and use the `--main` flag to define the new main file.

```bash
bit add ui/button --main button.ts
```
