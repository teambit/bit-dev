# Testing during Development

During development, the Tester optimizes for dev experience and performance. It tests modified components, in isolation, to help tackle issues quickly during development.

[`bit test`](/reference/bit-test) allows testing components in the workspace. Each component is tested im isolation with its configured tester as defined in the development env. 

```bash
bit test
```

```
testing total of 6 components in workspace 'docs-examples'
testing 5 components with environment company.scope/envs/my-react@b28b35cee4c99abcf304f746b9fadf94cfef4538

## Watch for changes and retest

Watching for component changes is done using the `--watch` flag.

```bash
bit test --watch
```

## Testing UI

Bit saves the test results and standarizes them to a single format, regardless of the specific test runner used. It provides a single, standard UI for testing components
during development, with live updates.

Bit watches for re-runs tests by default when starting the [Workspace](/workspace/overview) UI. 

```bash
bit start
```

<Image src={testResultsImg} />

Stopping the Tester from watching changes on bit start can be done using the `watchOnStart` config.
