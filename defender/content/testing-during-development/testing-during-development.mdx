# Testing during Development

During development, Bit tests your components using the `bit test` and `bit watch` commands. These commands
provide a standard dev experience for testing any kind of [Component](/components/overview), whether it is a NodeJS modules, a React component or anything else.

## Test all components in the Workspace

Bit tests all components in the [Workspace](/workspace/overview) regardless to the configured [Env](/envs/overview) and therefor tester,
with a single command.

```bash
bit test
```

## Watch for changes and retest

Watching for component changes and retesting can be done with a single command.

```bash
bit watch
```

Watch starts by default when starting the [Workspace](/workspace/overview) UI.

```bash
bit start
```

## Tester workspace configurations

The Tester aspect can be configured in the `workspace.jsonc` configuration file.

### watchOnStart

    "watchOnStart": false
  }
}
```

### patterns

For example:

```json
{
  "teambit.defender/tester": {
    "patterns": [
      "**/*.spec.+(js|ts|jsx|tsx)",
      "**/*.another-prefix.+(js|ts|jsx|tsx)"
    ]
  }
}
