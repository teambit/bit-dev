# Linting during Development

During development, Bit lints your components using the `bit lint`. That command provides a standard dev experience for linting any kind of [Component](/components/component-overview), whether it is a NodeJS modules, a React component or anything else.

## Lint all components in the Workspace

Bit lints all components in the [Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview) regardless to the configured [Env](/envs/envs-overview) and therefor tester, with a single command.

```bash
bit test
```

## Lint only components that changed

Use the `--changed` flag to lint only `new` and `modified` components. Use `bit status` to learn
which components are either `new` or `modified`.

```bash
bit compile --changed
```

## CLI References

The Linter can be configured in the `workspace.jsonc` configuration file.
