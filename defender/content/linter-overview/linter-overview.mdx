Bit's Linter simplifies and standardizes the process of component linting. It does so for linting during development (in the workspace) and for linting during component build (in a capsule, as part of the [Build Pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines))

Linting helps us maintain consistent code styling and avoid potential bugs by analyzing our source code, statically, before it is compiled and executed.


## Linting in development

Bit lints all components in the [Workspace](/workspace/overview) using just a single command. That is true for components of all types, regardless of their specific [Env](/envs/overview), and as a consequence of that, their specific Linter implementation<!-- [Linter implementation](#) --> and configuration.

```bash
bit lint
```

To learn more on linting during development, please refer to [Workspace Linting](/linter/workspace-linting).

## Linting during build

During build, the lint task is only used for checking linting issues. it will not re-write the components with the auto fix option.

Testing components for distribution is done during `build` by the Bit [Builder](/builder/overview).

Component build can be simulated with `bit build` and done through [Tag](/components/tags) or [Snap](/components/snaps)

```bash
bit build
```

By default, linting is **not** part of the [Build Pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines).

<!--TODO To learn more on linting during build and how to add a lint [Build Task](/builder/overview#build-task), please refer to [Linting During Build](#). -->

## Configuring and implementing Linters

The Linter implementation<!-- [Linter implementation](#) --> is configured in the [Env](/envs/overview) which is configured on your [Component](/components/overview). Customizing it can be done by customizing an existing env with your linter <!-- TODO [customizing an existing env with your linter](/) --> or by implementing your own Env <!-- [implementing your own Env](/envs/customizing-env) -->.

Linter can also be implemented into Bit through few interfaces. For more information on implementing your own linter please refer to [Implement a Linter](linter/implement-linter).
