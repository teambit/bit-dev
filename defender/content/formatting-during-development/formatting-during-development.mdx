# Formatting during Development

During development, Bit formats your components using the `bit format` commands. This command provides a standard dev experience for formatting the code of any kind of [Component](/components/overview), whether it is a NodeJS modules,
a React component or anything else.

## Format all components in the Workspace

Bit allows to format all components in the [Workspace](/workspace/overview) regardless to the configured [Env](/envs/overview) and therefore Formatter
with a single command.
The bit format command will re-write your components source code with the new format.
In case you only want to see which files has formatting issues, add the `--check` flag.

```bash
# Format components
bit format
```

```bash
# Check components for formatting issues
bit format --check
```

## Format only components that changed

You can also use the `--changed` flag to format only `new` and `modified` components. Use `bit status` to learn
which components are either `new` or `modified`.

```bash
bit format --changed
```
