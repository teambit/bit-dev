# Implement a Tester

Standard test runners are integrated into Bit using a Bit Aspect. For example, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is integrated into Bit using the [Jest Aspect](https://bit.dev/teambit/defender/jest).
These Aspects implement the [Tester interface](https://bit.dev/teambit/defender/tester/~code/tester.ts). A tester implementation should be able to provide [testing in the workspace](./workspace-testing) as well as [testing during build](./testing-during-build).

The easiest way to start implementing a tester is to create a new Bit Aspect using the `Aspect` template.

```bash title="Create a new Aspect component"
bit create aspect extensions/my-tester
```

As a convention, the tester interface is implemented in a file named with the `tester` prefix. Since it is a specific implementation file, it is not part of the generic Aspect component template and therefore needs to be created manually:

```bash title="Create a tester implementation file"
cd extensions/my-tester
touch my-tester.tester.ts
```

## Tester implementation file

:::note
When implementing testing in the workspace, make sure the tester implementation transpiles source files during testing. The tester receives the compiled code (compiled by the Env's [Compiler](/dev-services-overview/compiler/compiler-overview)) only during build.
For example, the Jest Aspect uses the `transform` option to do so.

### test

```js
test(context: TesterContext): Promise<Tests>;
```

- [`TesterContext`](https://bit.dev/teambit/defender/tester/~code/tester.ts)<!-- TODO: maybe change link to point to the builder docs here-->
- [`Tests`](https://bit.dev/teambit/defender/tester/~code/tester.ts)<!-- TODO: maybe change link to point to the builder docs here-->

The `test` method is used by Tester for testing in the workspace as well as during build. Use the received `context` object to handle both cases.

## watch (optional)

```ts
watch?(context: TesterContext): Promise<Tests>
```

Watch tests on all components

### onTestRunComplete (optional)

```ts
onTestRunComplete?(callback: CallbackFn): Promise<void>
```

on test run complete. (applies only during watch)

### version

```ts
version(): string;
```

Returns the tester version.

### displayConfig (optional)

```ts
displayConfig?(): string
```

The `displayConfig` function helps the user see the tester config when using the `bit env <comp-id>` command.
It should return a string representation of the tester config. (for example JSON.stringify of the tsconfig file)

### configPath (optional)

```ts
configPath?: string;
```

A path to the config of the specific tester in the filesystem.
for example path to the jest config file.

## Main runtime file

```ts
createTester(jestConfig: any, jestModulePath?: string): JestTester
```

Creates returns an instance of the implemented Tester.

For example:

```ts
createTester(jestConfig: any, jestModulePath = require.resolve('jest')) {
  return new JestTester(JestAspect.id, jestConfig, jestModulePath, this.jestWorker, this.logger);
}
```
