# Formatting during Build

By default, formatting is **not** part of the [Build Pipeline](/dev-services/builder/build-pipelines).

During build, the format task is only used for checking formatting issues. It will not re-write the components with the fixed format.
In case you want to re-format your components, you should use the `bit format` command on your workspace.

## Adding a formatter task to your build pipeline

To add your format task to your build pipeline you need to add its task into the build pipeline using the `getBuildPipe` of your env:
(built in envs come with an API to only add new tasks to their existing pipe)<!-- TODO: add link here -->

```ts
  getBuildPipe(modifiers: GetBuildPipeModifiers = {}): BuildTask[] {
    return [...someTasks, formatterTask];
  }
```

To implement your own Formatter, [see here](/dev-services/formatter/implement-formatter).
