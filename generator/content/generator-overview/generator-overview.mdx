# Generator Overview

<ComponentCardDisplay componentIds={[
  'teambit.generator/generator',
]} style={{ float: 'left', margin: 20, maxWidth: 250 }} />

Generators enable the generation new components and workspaces with templates. You can either use Bit's pre-defined templates or you can create your own.  

You can create generators as standalone components or as part of an env.

Use a generator to standardize and automate the creation of new components and workspaces.

The `teambit.generator/generator` aspect provides a single point of entry to component and workspace generation, depending on where you are in your flow.

## Workspace templates

Bit comes with a pre-defined list of workspace templates. When not in a Bit workspace, you can run the following command to see them:

```bash
bit templates
```

```bash
The following template(s) are available with the command bit new: 
Example - bit new <template-name> <workspace-name>
teambit.react/react
    react (React workspace with demo components)
...
```

Each template may contain several items:

- Configuration for your `workspace.jsonc` file.
- Dependencies.
- New components.

To use any of the pre-built templates, run the following command:

```bash
bit new react my-workspace
```

## Component templates

While in a workspace, the `templates` command lists all available component templates.

```bash
bit templates
```

```bash
The following template(s) are available with the command bit create:  
Example - bit create <template-name> <component-name>

teambit.react/react
    react (a basic react component)
    react-context (a react context component)
    react-hook (a react hook component)
    react-js (a basic react component in js)
    react-env (customize the base React env with your configs and tools)

teambit.harmony/aspect
    aspect (extend Bit capabilities)

teambit.html/html
    html-env (customize the base Html env with your configs and tools)
    html (a basic html component)
...
```

Use the `bit create` command to create a new component from a template.

```bash
bit create react my-component
```
