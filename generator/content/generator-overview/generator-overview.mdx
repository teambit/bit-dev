# Generator Overview

<ComponentCardDisplay componentIds={[
  'teambit.generator/generator',
]} style={{ float: 'left', margin: 20, maxWidth: 250 }} />

Generator enable generating new components and workspaces with templates. You can either use Bit's pre-defined templates or create your own.  
You may create generator as standalone components or as part of an env.

Use generator to standardize and automate the creation of new components and workspaces.

The `teambit.generator/generator` aspect provides a single point of entry to component and workspace generation, depending where you are in your flow.

## Workspace templates

Bit comes with a pre-defined list of workspace templates. To see them run the following command, when not in a Bit workspace:

```bash
bit templates
```

```bash
The following template(s) are available with the command bit new: 
Example - bit new <template-name> <workspace-name>
teambit.react/react
    react (React workspace with demo components)
...
```

Each template may contain several items:

- Configuration for your `workspace.jsonc` file.
- Dependencies.
- New components.

To use any of the pre-built templates, run the following command:

```bash
bit new react my-workspace
```

## Component templates

While in a workspace, the `templates` command lists all available component templates.

```bash
bit templates
```

```bash
The following template(s) are available with the command bit create:  
Example - bit create <template-name> <component-name>

teambit.react/react
    react (a basic react component)
    react-context (a react context component)
    react-hook (a react hook component)
    react-js (a basic react component in js)
    react-env (customize the base React env with your configs and tools)

teambit.harmony/aspect
    aspect (extend Bit capabilities)

teambit.html/html
    html-env (customize the base Html env with your configs and tools)
    html (a basic html component)
...
```

Use the `bit create` command to create a new component from a template.

```bash
bit create react my-component
```
