Welcome to the Bit documentation site! This site is a composition of independent components, built and maintained mainly by the Docs, Design and Community teams here at Bit! It was built from React, Markdown, and Node components we have crafted specifically for the purpose and needs of this app.

## Introduction

<!-- During this quick start, you will learn to create your own **composable analytics dashboard**. We will show you how simple it is to build even a complex app like an analytics dashboard made from components! -->
In a world of Data, data presentation and analytics are fundamental tools for steering almost any activity. However, connecting all the different pieces and bringing the right data to the right people in a highly personalized experience can be hard.

Through components and composability, you can tap directly into any data stream, be it the database or a 3rd party tool integration, and visualize it in a fully customizable and composable Lego-like dashboard where everyone can have a fully personalized view.
Each team can create, maintain and own the data components relevant to them.

<!-- In this example quick start we'll install Bit, create a workspace, and use a few ready-made components from our basic Team Bit analytics dashboard to kickstart your own composable data analytics experience.
Check out this sample dashboard with mock data to see component-driven analytics in action, then start creating your own experience! -->
