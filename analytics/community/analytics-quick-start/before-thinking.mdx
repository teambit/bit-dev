<!-- ## Getting started

Now that you have Bit installed, and your workspace is up and running it is time to start building with components.
Our analytics app is built out of the components you see below, click on each of them to get an explanation of what their responsebilities are, how to use them, and why we chose them. -->

## Our analytics dashboard

This simple example showcases a few components from our analytics Scope. Many other components from the analytics scope can also be used to create your dashboard. Feel free to explore the [analytics scope](https://bit.cloud/teambit/analytics) for more options, or start by reviewing the components we chose for this example.

<!-- Using components as a consumer early on the development process helps avoid uncertainty and achieve faster and more accurate results. -->
