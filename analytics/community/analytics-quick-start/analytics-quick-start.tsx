          As you start to build with components, remember - choosing the first component is an important step in the
          process. When choosing the first component, focus on choosing the most tangible component, the one you can
          ideally use now. In this case, We start with a dashboard component, that shows a metric-card, bar-chart,
          line-chart, pie-chart and table components.

          Now that we have a dashboard, we can start filling it with data-components. You can benefit from efficient
          collaboration by allowing different people or teams to create and maintain data components to your dashboard.
          Easily aligning whole teams into one dashboard. The first data component we are using is a bar chart tracking
          new users - managed by our community team.
