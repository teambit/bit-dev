import { Terminal } from './terminal';

This component displays CLI commands and outputs in a UI that mimics the terminal.

## Basic usage

Use the `content` prop to pass the content you wish to display:

```js live
<Terminal content="hello from Terminal" />
```

Set the `animate` prop to `true` to gradually reveal the content (as if it is being written out to the terminal). Use the `delay` prop to set the speed (milliseconds delay for each character):

```js live
<Terminal content="hello from Terminal" animate={false} delay={140} />
```
