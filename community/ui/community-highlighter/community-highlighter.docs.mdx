import { LeftRight } from '@teambit/design.ui.layouts.sections.left-right';
import { Example } from './example/example-component';
import ExampleSnippet from './example/example-snippet.mdx';
import { CommunityHighlighter } from './community-highlighter';

Community Highlighter enables you to visually inspect React components so as to reveal the component IDs of their descendant components.
It makes public components more discoverable and promotes open-source contributions in the Bit community.
The data retrieved and displayed by Community Highlighter was injected into the _preview_ bundle of the (inspected) component by [Bit's babel plugin](https://bit.dev/teambit/react/babel/bit-react-transformer).

## Basic usage

Wrap your components with Community Highlighter to enable inspection:

<LeftRight
  left={<ExampleSnippet />}
  right={<Example />}
  style={{ marginTop: '2em', marginBottom: '2em' }}
/>

## Disabling the highlighter

You can disable the highlighter using the highlighter's [`Toggler`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/community/ui/highlighter-example/~code/toggler.composition.tsx) component, or using its [`useHighlighter`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/community/ui/highlighter-example/~code/use-highlighter.composition.tsx) hook.
The highlighter's state (`disable = true/false`) is persisted in the local storage.
