import { LeftRight } from '@teambit/design.ui.layouts.sections.left-right';
import { Example } from './example/example-component';
import ExampleSnippet from './example/example-snippet.mdx';
import { CommunityHighlighter } from './community-highlighter';

Community Highlighter helps you discover components by revealing the component IDs of UI elements in a page.
The highlighter data is injected into the component's bundle <!-- TODO: change the link to the relevant page in the docs --> using [Bit's babel plugin](https://bit.dev/teambit/react/babel/bit-react-transformer).
This plugin is used by default in application built with the [React app-type](https://bit.dev/teambit/react/react).

## Basic usage

Wrap your components with Community Highlighter to enable inspection:

<LeftRight left={<ExampleSnippet />} right={<Example />} />

Fork this demo component, to try the highlighter in your workspace:

```bash
bit fork learnbit.community/ui/highlighter-example
```

## Disabling the highlighter

You can disable the highlighter using the highlighter's `Toggler` component, or using its `useHighlighter` hook.
The highlighter's state (`disable: boolean`) is persisted in the local storage.

- Check the [`example-with-use-highlighter.tsx`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/community/ui/highlighter-example/~code/example-with-use-highlighter.tsx) file to learn how to use the use-highlighter hook
