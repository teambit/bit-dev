Welcome to the Bit documentation site! This site is a composition of independent components, built and maintained mainly by the Docs, Design and Community teams here at Bit! It was built from React, Markdown, and Node components we have crafted specifically for the purpose and needs of this app.

## Introduction
Most web application needs data from the server. Data fetching allows you to connect app users and real data to create meaningful interactions. Using components
to fetch and structure data allows for greater consistency, easier integrations and reusability.

<!-- 
In this example quick start we'll install Bit, create a workspace, and use a few ready-made components to show how data-fetching is done in a composable way with Bit.

Check out this sample app example to see component-driven data fetching in action. When you're done exploring go ahead and dive into the example quickstart below. -->
