Welcome to the Bit documentation site! This site is a composition of independent components, built and maintained mainly by the Docs, Design and Community teams here at Bit! It was built from React, Markdown, and Node components we have crafted specifically for the purpose and needs of this app.

## Introduction


React lets you build apps in components which is great. But placing all these components in a monolith with one codebase, version, and build means you canâ€™t enjoy the powerful benefits of components and modularity.

In this example, we will show you how to create a simple React application that is composable and each component is independent and decoupled. Just like Lego, you can easily scale your application, add or remove components, modify anything, fix bugs and release per-component changes, mix and match technologies, and easily collaborate with others on the same app without competing over versions or having to work in the same codebase. 

<!-- 
In this example quick start we'll install Bit, create a workspace, and use a few ready-made components to build a basic React application you can later extend and add more components, features (front or backend!), and developers.
Check out this React app example to see component-driven development in action. When you're done exploring go ahead and dive into the example quickstart below. -->
