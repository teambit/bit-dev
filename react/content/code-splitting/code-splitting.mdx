# Code Splitting

Code splitting allows you to reduce bundle size and optimize app performance by loading components at runtime.


```ts
import()
```

## Transpiling ES6
Code splitting components requires transpiling them to ES6 module format. Please make sure to configure your compiler 
to output an ES6 module for code splitting to function properly.

## Code splitting strategies

### Page splitting
Our [base-react Page component](https://bit.dev/teambit/base-react/pages/page) supports code splitting by default and loads.

## Configuring Webpack SplitChunks Plugin in the React env

```ts
useWebpack();
```
