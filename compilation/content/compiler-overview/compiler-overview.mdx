The Compiler aspect provides a single interface for Component compilation, [during development](/dev-services/compiler/compiling-during-development) and [during build](/dev-services/compiler/compiling-during-build).
It enables you to use the same commands and APIs to compile any Component, regardless of the specific compiler it uses.

Specific compilers used by a Component ([Babel](https://bit.cloud/teambit/compilation/babel), [TypeScript](https://bit.cloud/teambit/typescript/typescript), and so on) are set by the [Component's Env](/envs/using-envs).

## Compiling during development

Run the following to compile all your Workspace Components:

```bash
bit compile
```

The following output lists the compilation results in a single format:

```bash
  STATUS        COMPONENT ID
✔ SUCCESS       apps/bit-dev
✔ SUCCESS       blocks/component/architecture-breakdown
✔ SUCCESS       blocks/footer
✔ SUCCESS       blocks/header
✔ SUCCESS       buttons/button
✔ SUCCESS       content/adding-components
```

To 'watch' Components for changes, and to auto-compile modified Components, run:

```bash
bit watch
```

The compiled code is written into each Component's corresponding package, in the [`node_modules` directory](/dependencies/node-modules) of your workspace.
For example, the compiled code for `company.scope/ui/text` will be found in the `./node_modules/@company/scope.ui.text/dist` directory (inside your workspace).

To learn more about compilation in the Workspace, see ['Compiling during development'](/dev-services/compiler/compiling-during-development).

## Compiling during build

Run the following to compile Components as part of the [build pipeline](/dev-services/builder/build-pipelines) (which prepares Components for distribution):

```bash
bit build
```

The output to the terminal details the specific compilers being used, as well as the Envs that use them:

```bash
...
✔ env "teambit.harmony/aspect", task "teambit.compilation/compiler:BabelCompiler (compile components for artifact dist)" has completed successfully in 363ms
✔ env "teambit.react/react", task "teambit.compilation/compiler:TSCompiler (compile components for artifact dist)" has completed successfully in 1s
✔ env "teambit.mdx/mdx", task "teambit.compilation/compiler:MDXCompiler (compile components)" has completed successfully in 879ms
...
the build has been completed. total: 19 tasks
```

The compiled code is written into the [Component's Capsule](/components/structure/component-capsules). Run [`bit snap`](/components/snaps) or [`bit tag`](/components/tags) to execute the build pipeline (as well as other pipelines), and have the compiled code persisted in the [Component version](/components/navigating-history), and included in the component's package.

To learn more about compilation in the Workspace, see ['Compiling during build'](/dev-services/compiler/compiling-during-build).

## Compilation strategies and standards

The Compiler aspect does not set specific compilation strategies as these are defined by the [specific compilers](/dev-services/compiler/compiler-overview) themselves (and are often configurable by the Envs that use them).

However, all official Bit compilers are configured to favor dev experience when compiling during development, and to favor runtime performance and code universality, when compiling for distribution (during build).

For example, Bit's TypeScript compiler performs type-checking when compiling during build but skips it when compiling during development.
This enables faster compilation and better dev experience.

To examine a Component's specific compiler config, run the following:

```bash
bit env get COMPONENT_ID
```

For example:

```bash
bit env get company.demo/ui/card
```

The output details the Component's env config which includes the compiler config:

```bash
Environment: teambit.react/react
...
teambit.compilation/compiler

configured compiler: teambit.typescript/typescript (TypeScript @ 4.4.2)
compiler config:
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": [
      "es2019",
      "DOM",
      "ES6",
      "DOM.Iterable"
    ],
    "target": "es2015",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "jsx": "react",
    "declaration": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "exclude": [
    "dist"
  ]
}

```

## Setting a Component with a specific compiler

Specific compilers are applied on Components via the Components' Envs. For example, the `company.demo/ui/card` Component examined earlier, is applied with
the TypeScript compiler by its Env, the React Env.

To learn how to use a specific compiler, see ['Using compilers'](/dev-services/compiler/using-a-compiler).
