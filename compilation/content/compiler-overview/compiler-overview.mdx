# Compiler overview


The *Compiler* provides a unified interface for compiling components regardless of the specific compiler they use.

## Compiling during development

<!-- During development, you can compile all components using a unified command line interface: -->

To compile all Components, whether they use Babel, TypeScript or any other compiler, run:

```bash
bit compile
```

The compilation process results in a single standardized output to the terminal, similar to the following:

```bash
  STATUS        COMPONENT ID
✔ SUCCESS       apps/bit-dev
✔ SUCCESS       blocks/component/architecture-breakdown
✔ SUCCESS       blocks/footer
✔ SUCCESS       blocks/header
✔ SUCCESS       buttons/button
✔ SUCCESS       content/adding-components
```


Components can be watched for changes and recompiled with a single command as well.

```bash
bit watch
```

To learn more on compilation during development, please refer to [Workspace Compilation](/compiler/workspace-compilation).

## Compiling during build

Compiling components for distribution is done in a Capsule, as part of the [Build Pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines).

Component build can be simulated with `bit build` and done through [Tag](/components/tags) or [Snap](/components/snaps)

```bash
bit build
```

By default, Bit includes a [Build Task](/) for compiling components in the [Build Pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines) using the Compiler of your choice which is configured in the [Env](/envs/overview). Compilation for distribution is optimized for runtime performance, consistency and reusability. This means Source Maps <!--TODO [Source Maps](/)  -->are not being generated, target is preferred to be compatible with vast majority of browsers, bundlers and JS execution engines and Types are generated for the component, which can be costly in performance.

<!--TODO To learn more on compilation for distribution, please refer to [Compiling for distribution](/). -->

## Configuring and Implementing Compilers

Compilers are configured in the [Env](/envs/overview) which is configured on your [Component](/components/overview). Customizing the Compiler can be done by [customizing an existing env with your compiler](/compiler/configure-env) or by [implementing your own Env](/).
