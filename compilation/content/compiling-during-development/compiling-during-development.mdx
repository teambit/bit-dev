# Compiling during development

During development, Bit compiles your components using the `bit compile` and `bit watch` commands. This commands
are providing a standard dev experience for compiling any kind of [Component](/components/component-overview), whether it is a NodeJS modules, a React component or anything else.

Compilation of components in the [Workspace](/components/component-overview) is optimized for dev experience, performance and debugging by default.

This means Source Maps <!--TODO [Source Maps](/) --> are generated and components are just transpiled (without types) into in the `node_modules` directory to ensure consistency between using a component for development or consumption purposes.

:::note
For type resolution in the Workspace we rely on the [Workspace Component Links](/workspace/structure/component-links) which symlinks the source code from within the link to the corresponding [Component Directory](/workspace/structure/component-links).

```bash title="workspace component links"
├── node_modules
    ├── @my-org
        ├── ui.button
          ├── dist
              ├── index.js
              ├── index.js.map
              ├── button.js
              ├── button.js.map
          ├── ...
```

## Compile all components in the workspace

Bit allows to compile all components in the [Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview) regardless to the configured [Env](/envs/envs-overview) and therefore Compiler
with a single command.

```bash
bit compile
```

<!-- ## Compile only components that changed

You can also use the `--changed` flag to compile only `new` and `modified` components. Use `bit status` to learn
which components are either `new` or `modified`.

```bash
bit compile --changed
``` -->

## Compile with a verbose output

Using the `--verbose` flag you can easily which files got generated for each component and where they were
persisted.

```bash
bit compile --verbose
```

```bash

✔ 20/20 components compiled successfully.
```

## Watch for changes and recompile

Watching for component changes and recompiling can be done with a single command.

```bash
bit watch
```

Watch starts by default when starting the [Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview) UI.

```bash
bit start
```
