# Configuring scopes

The `scope.json` is the scope's config file.

```
{
    "name": "scope-name",
    "remotes": {},
    "version": "1.0.172",
    "lanes": {
        "current": "main",
        "tracking": []
    }
}
```

### name

The scope's name. [Local scopes](/workspace/local-scope) are named by their Workspace name.

When creating your own scope, the `name` is set, by default, to the hosting directory:

```
cd my-scope
bit init --bare
```

```json
{
  "name": "my-scope",
  "remotes": {},
  "version": "1.0.172",
  "lanes": {
    "current": "main",
    "tracking": []
  }
}
```

### remotes

The `remotes` property holds the mapping of scope names and their corresponding URLs. This is primarily used to configure non Bit Cloud scopes in a workspace (e.g, `bit remote add http://localhost:3001`)

```json
{
  "remotes": {
    "my-scope": "http://localhost:3002"
  }
  // ..
}
```
