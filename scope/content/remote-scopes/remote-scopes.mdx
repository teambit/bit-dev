# Using Remote Scopes

:::tip This page is for teams looking to self-host a Bit Scope.
:::

Collaborating on Bit components require setting up remote scopes accessible for all collaborators. Remote scopes should also be accessible for one-another, so that they can have dependencies.

Managing a distributed network of scopes requires each node in the network to know which remotes to communicate with. These nodes are called `remotes` in Bit, and managing them, regardless of whether the node is a developer workstation or a remote scope, is done with the `remote` command.

## Remotes for the workspace

When you set up a remote scope, all developers that need to be able to access the scope should add it as a remote:

```bash
bit remote add http://{host}:{host-port}
```

When a scope is added as a remote, a workspace may export/import components and use the scope.

## Network of scopes

If you have components that depend on components from other scopes, you need to inter-connect the scopes. 

For example, if a component in scope **billing** is dependent on a component in scope **design-system**, you need to make scope **billing** aware of scope **design-system**. To do this, first log to the machine hosting **billing** and run:

```bash
bit remote add http://{design-system-host}:{host-port}
```

The network needs to have remote pointing in the direction of the dependencies. So if **design-system** is dependent on **billing**, you need to add **billing** as a remote to **design-system** as well.

## Automate with a scope resolver

Another option is to define a resolve function that resolves the scopes. The function is defined in the `scope.json` in the scope, and Bit uses it whenever it needs to resolve paths between scopes.

```javascript
{
  "name": "bit.envs",
  "remotes": {},
  "resolverPath": "/app/resolver.js"
}
```

The function gets the destination scope name (the destination from to get the dependency) and source scope name (the scope that has the dependent) as parameters. It should return a valid URL of the destination, e.g: `file:///tmp/my-scope-name`. 

The example below is code taken from Bit.cloud:

```javascript
// /app/resolver.js
const http = require('http');
module.exports = (dst, src) =>
  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    http.get(
      `http://bit-permissions-service/scopes?src=${src}&dst=${dst}`,
      (res) => {
        res.setEncoding('utf8');
        let rawData = '';
        res.on('data', (chunk) => (rawData += chunk));
        res.on('end', () =>
          res.statusCode === 200
            ? resolve(`file:///tmp/bithub/${JSON.parse(rawData).payload}`)
            : reject({
                code: 134,
                message:
                  `unable to export components to ${src} because they have dependencies on components in ${dst}. ` +
                  'bit does not allow setting dependencies between components in private scopes managed by different owners.',
                sourceScope: dst,
                destinationScope: src,
              })
        );
      }
    )
  );
```
