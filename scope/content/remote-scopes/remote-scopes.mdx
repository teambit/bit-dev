# Remotes

:::tip This page is for teams looking to self-host a Bit Scope.

A Remote Scope needs to have access to other Remote Scopes so that its Components could have Component from other Remote Scopes as their dependencies. 

Managing a distributed network of scopes requires each node in the network to know about the others. These nodes are called `remotes` in Bit, and managing them is done using the `remote` command.

## Link remote scopes

If you have components that depend on components from other scopes, you need to inter-connect the scopes. For example if a component in scope **billing** is dependent on a component in scope **design-system**, you need to make scope **billing** aware of scope **design-system**.
To do this, first log to the machine hosting **billing** and run:

```bash
bit remote add http://{design-system-host}:{host-port}
```

The network needs to have remote pointing in the direction of the dependencies. So if **design-system** is dependent on **billing**, you need to add **billing** as a remote to **design-system** as well.

## Link a workspace to a remote scope

When you set up a remote scope, all developers that need to be able to access the scope should add it as a remote:

```bash
bit remote add http://{host}:{host-port}
```

When a scope is added as a remote, a workspace may export/import components and use the scope.
