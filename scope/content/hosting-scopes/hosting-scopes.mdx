# Hosting Scopes

:::tip This page is for teams looking to self-host a Bit Scope.

:::info This guide assumes familiarity with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
:::

When building your on-site hosting for Bit scopes, we recommend using a solution like Docker. This guide will walk you through the various aspects of managing multiple scopes, their storage, and how to ensure backup and monitoring.

## Docker images

In this guide you will use the base images provided by Bit as a platform.

- **[bit-cli container](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitcli/bit)** is an image generated with each new release of Bit. It includes the latest version of Bit pre-installed.
- **[bare-scope container](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitcli/bit-server)** is an image that uses the **bit-cli container** and provides a bare scope.

If you prefer building your own image, you can use this base dockerfile as a starter:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:12.22.0
USER root

RUN npm i @teambit/bvm -g
RUN bvm upgrade
ENV PATH=$PATH:/root/bin

# increase memory to avoid 137 error code
ENV NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096

RUN bit config set analytics_reporting false
RUN bit config set no_warnings false
RUN bit config set interactive false
RUN bit config set error_reporting true

ARG SCOPE_PATH=/root/remote-scope
WORKDIR ${SCOPE_PATH}
RUN bit init --bare
CMD bit start
```

## Hosting scope on a container

Start by using the `bitcli/bit-server` to setup a scope:

```bash
docker run -it -p {host-port}:3000 bitcli/bit-server:latest
```

Now open your browser and go to:

```bash
http://localhost:{host-port}
```

To export components to the scope, add it as a remote to your workstation:

```bash
bit remote add http://localhost:{host-port}
```

In your project's `workspace.json` file configure the `defaultScope` according to the scope name.  
Use the `export` command to share your components:

```bash
bit export
```

## Managing scopes and storage

### Using specific version of bit on the bit server

Set a specific version for your server by using the `BIT_VERSION` argument:

```bash
docker build -f ./Dockerfile-bit-server --build-arg BIT_VERSION={version} -t bitcli/bit-server:{version} .
```

### Change bare scope name and location on the server container

The scope name is defined by the folder name of the containing scope (`remote-scope` by default).
This name is then later used for setting it up in the `workspace.jsonc` file.
In case you want to change it you can pass the build arg called `SCOPE_PATH` like `--build-arg SCOPE_PATH=/root/custom-remote-scope`

### Using volume to make sure data is persisted

To persist the scope data, you need the scope folder to be mounted from the host. You can use [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) for example:

```bash
docker run -it -v {scope-path-on-host}:/root/remote-scope -p {host-port}:3000 bitcli/bit-server:latest
```

_It's recommended to use volumes or have an orchestrator like kubernetes handle mounts._

:::info Single storage

Bit is using different in memory cache mechanisms. Mounting the same storage directory to different instances of the same container, may produce unexpected results.

:::

### Combining scope volume with scope name/location

When combining a change of the scope name/location and volume, you have to make sure the location provided in the `SCOPE_PATH` in the build arg is matching the target in the volume:

```bash
docker run -it -v {scope-path-on-host}:/root/custom-remote-scope -build-arg SCOPE_PATH=/root/custom-remote-scope -p {host-port}:3000 bitcli/bit-server:latest
```

See the `/root/custom-remote-scope` is used both in the `-v` arg after the `:` and as the `SCOPE_PATH` value.

### Watch bit server logs on host machine

Since the `bit start` command at the moment can't be run as detached, you will need a way to run it as the main command and to monitor the logs at the same time.

You can mount the logs directory on the container to a directory in the host.

For example:

```bash
docker run -it -v {logs-dir-on-host}:/root/Library/Caches/Bit/logs -p {host-port}:3000 bitcli/bit-server:latest
```

_It's recommended to use [tmpfs-mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/tmpfs/)._

## Publish Component Packages to npm

A Scope handles export and import operations. To make you components installable as packages (`npm install`/`bit install`) [configure them to be published to a package registry](https://bit.dev/docs/packages/publishing-components-to-commonjs-registries).

:::info Bit Cloud as a package registry
Components exported to scopes hosted on Bit Cloud can be installed from Bit Cloud (no need for additional configuration).
