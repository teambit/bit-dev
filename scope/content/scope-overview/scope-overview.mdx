# Scope Overview

Scope is a server for hosting components. Scopes help teams to share and use each other's components as by preserving team autonomy through versioning, forking, storing dependencies, and collaborate on changes of independent components.
Scopes defines ownership on components, as a single team owns the components exported to scope.

## Full stack of functionality

Scopes host components of any kind, from React, Angular and Node modules, all the way to a frontend apps or microservices. For a scope they are all Bit Components.  
For example, the [MDX scope](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx) contains all components relevant to handling MDX functionality in Bit. It exposes various types of components (or "APIs") to achieve this: Webpack loader, Node modules, React components and even a [Bit Aspect](/). This makes it easy for other teams to take leverage of MDX, not just as a feature but also as an API for their features.

Scopes support various methods for using components, from adding as dependencies to runtime integrations, allowing the consumer to decide how whats the best solution for their use case.

## Team collaboration using components

Scopes provides visibility to components built by other teams, this is the first step towards better collaboration. Developers can find, use and depend on components by other teams. Instead of reinventing the wheel and rebuilding the same functionality, component visibility drives for collaboration. It is similar to how teams build with microservices and build team communication and collaboration by using each-other's APIs.  
Moreover, developers can use `bit import` and access to any component's source code and contribute change to collaborate on components.

Bit keeps track on all these dependencies and flows, making team collaboration visible, easy to extend and optimize.

## Distributed and autonomous

Hosted scopes form a distributed network, where each scope is connected to the other scopes according to component dependencies. Each scope stores not only the components it hosts, but also the dependencies of those components.  
When you export a component, the scope then does network calls to fetch the dependencies of the component from their respective scopes. This means that each scope becomes autonomous, as it contains all the dependencies needed to its components to run. In turn this makes teams more autonomous, as they can now build and use their components without having to worry about the dependencies.

Scopes use standard HTTP for inner-scope communication, however, when building a network of scopes, you need to ensure scopes are able to connect to one another to fetch dependencies.

## Source of truth

Scopes become the source of truth for components. Allowing different stakeholders to collaborate and work together from the same, or from different Workspaces.
Components can be maintained from multiple Workspaces in parallel, while Scopes are keeping them in sync, merging changes for all ends.

`bit import` can be used to fetch component updates. Using `bit import` is similar to using `git fetch` where new objects are being fetched but not checked out in your workspace.  

```bash
$ bit import
⡃⢐ fetching 143 components from 18 remotes. delta-only: 143, all-history: 0.
- up to date teambit.community/ui/hero   
- up to date teambit.community/ui/homepage/sections/distribution   
- updated teambit.design/ui/layouts/sections/left-right   
- updated teambit.design/ui/layouts/sections/section-group   
- updated teambit.design/ui/layouts/sections/top-down   
```

`bit export` is used to share component changes with others. It pushes new objects from a local Workspace to a remote Scope, allowing others to keep in sync with the latest
component changes.

```bash
$ bit export
exported 8 components successfully to remote scope `community`
```
