# Scope Overview 

Scope is a distributed component collaboration host. You can think of it as a micro service, which helps set team and ownership boundaries and allows others to use components as APIs and collaborate on 
them. 
Scopes are empowering teams to share and use components, while preserving autonomy through versioning, forking, collaboration over changes and independent delivery.

## Full stack
Scopes can host components of any kind, whether they are React components, Node modules, Angular modules or even a front-end application or a micro service. All are just components
configured with different Envs. It is where a team can share its APIs. It can also serve components for usage through any method, whether its runtime or build time, providing the best solution for 
every use case.  

In the example below, you can see the MDX scope which exposes different type of component APIs including a Webpack loader, a Node module, React components and even a [Bit Aspect](/) 
that makes it easy for other teams to take legerage of MDX, not just as a feature but also as an API.

## Team collaboration
Teams can take leverage of components built by other teams by using each of their component APIs, just like we do with micro services. Teams can depend on each other functionallity rather
than reinventing wheels, and build on what is already built instead. Moreover, teams can get access to any component's source code and contribute to each other.
Relationships between teams becomes visible and easy to maintain and optimize.

## Distributed
Scopes are distributed and can be hosted on any server. Scopes can be formed to a distributed network through dependencies which are determines by the dependency relations between
the components they consist. In the above chart, each Scope can host on a different server but be connected to others. 

## Source of truth
Scopes become the source of truth for components. Allowing different stake holders to collabroate and work together from the same, or from different Workspaces.
Components can be maintained from multiple Workspaces in parralel, while Scopes are keeping them in sync, merging changes for all ends. 

`bit import` can be used to fetch component updates. Using `bit import` is similiar to using `git fetch` where new objects are being fetched but not checked out in your workspace.  

```bash
$ bit import
⡃⢐ fetching 143 components from 18 remotes. delta-only: 143, all-history: 0.
- up to date teambit.community/ui/hero   
- up to date teambit.community/ui/homepage/sections/distribution   
- updated teambit.design/ui/layouts/sections/left-right   
- updated teambit.design/ui/layouts/sections/section-group   
- updated teambit.design/ui/layouts/sections/top-down   
```

`bit export` is used to share component changes with others. It pushes new objects from a local Workspace to a remote Scope, allowing others to keep in sync with the latest
component changes.

```bash
$ bit export
exported 8 components successfully to remote scope `community`
```

## Autonomy
Scopes preserve

## Visibility
Scopes provides visibility to components, which is the first step towards better collboration.

## Safety


## Network protocols
Workspace can be configured to communicate through either HTTP or SSH and local directories (file://). HTTP is the default and recommended form. For HTTP, a server must be ramped up
and listen and incoming http requests.
