# Create a Bare Scope

:::tip This page is for teams looking to self-host a Bit Scope.
:::

When setting a scope you create a remote storage server for components. Various workspaces may import/export components from that scope.  
A **bare scope** includes storage and a UI server for your team.

To create a bare scope run the following command in a new directory:

```bash
bit init --bare
```

Bit creates the following files and directories:

```bash
.
├── components
├── objects
├── scope.json
└── tmp
```

## Start the Server

To use the bare scope you need to start the scope-server. The server allows for `import` and `export` of components, as well as a web UI for showcasing components.

```bash
bit start
```

```bash
Building UI assets for 'my-scope' in target directory: public/bit. The first time we build the UI it may take a few minutes.


You can now view 'my-scopes' components in the browser.
Bit server is running on http://localhost:3002
```

## Add your Scope to a Workspace

Configure the bare scope as a **remote** for your workstation:

```bash
cd my-workspace
bit remote add http://localhost:3001 # scope url
```

## Configure a Workspaces to Use the Scope

Configure Workspaces to use your scope using the scope name.

```json
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
    "defaultScope": "my-scope"
  },
```

You can now export components to the new scope.

For example:

```bash
bit export
```

```bash
exported the following 1 component(s):
my-scope/ui/heading
```

<Image src={scopeUiFull} width="70%" />

## Publish Component Packages to npm

A Scope handles export and import operations. To make your components installable as packages (`npm install`/`bit install`) [configure them to be published to a package registry](/packages/publishing-components-to-commonjs-registries).
