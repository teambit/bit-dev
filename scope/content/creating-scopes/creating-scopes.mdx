# Create a scope

:::tip This page is for teams looking to self-host a Bit Scope.
To host and manage your Scopes on [Bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) see [Scopes on Bit.cloud](/scope/scope-bit-cloud).
:::

When you [initialize a new workspace](/workspace/creating-workspaces#initialize-a-workspace-on-an-existing-project) you also initialize a new [scope](/workspace/local-scope). This scope is used internally by the [workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview).

To create a scope without the rest of the workspace (components in the working directory, `.bitmap` file, etc.), use the `--bare` option.
The initialized scope can then be used as collaboration server for components across workspaces (not just for the internal use of a single workspace).

The following example initializes a new scope and sets its name (in the [`scope.json`](/workspace/local-scope#scope.json) file) to its directory name, `my-scope`. This name will later be used to configure components with that scope.

```bash
mkdir my-scope
cd my-scope
bit init --bare
```

## Start the server

The server offers a UI that displays the exported components and handles the `export`/`import` requests to the scope.
Run the following to start the server:

```bash
bit start
```

The output should include the scope name and the URL for its server:

```bash
Building UI assets for 'my-scope' in target directory: public/bit. The first time we build the UI it may take a few minutes.


You can now view 'my-scopes' components in the browser.
Bit server is running on http://localhost:3001
```

## Connect a scope to a workspace

To use your newly-created scope, configure it in the relevant workspaces. Run the following, inside each workspace directory:

```
bit remote add SCOPE_SERVER_URL
```

For example:

```bash
cd my-workspace
bit remote add http://localhost:3001
```

:::info
The `bit remote add` command registers the scope URL in the Workspace's [Local Scope](/workspace/local-scope) config ([`scope.json`](/scope/configuring-scopes#remotes)).
:::

## Configure components to use a scope

You can configure components in your workspace to use a self hosted scope by setting the scope name.

```json
"defaultScope": "my-scope"
```

To export components to that scope, run the following:

```
bit export
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```
exported the following 1 component(s):
my-scope/ui/heading
```

## Publish Component Packages to npm

A Scope handles export and import operations. To make you components installable as packages (`npm install`/`bit install`) [configure them to be published to a package registry](/packages/publishing-components-to-commonjs-registries).

:::info Bit Cloud as a package registry
Components exported to scopes hosted on Bit Cloud can be installed from Bit Cloud (no need for additional configuration).
