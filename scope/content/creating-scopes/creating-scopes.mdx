# Create a scope

:::tip This page is for teams looking to self-host a Bit Scope.
To host and manage your Scopes on [Bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) see [Scopes on Bit.cloud](/scope/scope-bit-cloud).
:::

When a [Workspace is initialized](/workspace/creating-workspaces#initialize-a-workspace-on-an-existing-project), a [Local Scope](/workspace/local-scope) (located in `.bit` or `.git/bit`) is initialized, as well. This scope is used by the [Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview), for its internal processes.

To create the Scope, without the rest of the Workspace (the working directory), use the `--bare` option (this Scope will be used by multiple Workspaces, and not just for the internal use of a single one).

```bash
mkdir my-scope
cd my-scope
bit init --bare
```

This will initialize a new Scope, and set the `name` property in its [`scope.json`](/workspace/local-scope#scope.json) to the name of its hosting directory (in this case `my-scope`).

## Start the server

The server offers a UI that displays the exported components, and handles the `export`/`import` requests to the Scope.

```bash
bit start
```

```bash
Building UI assets for 'my-scope' in target directory: public/bit. The first time we build the UI it may take a few minutes.


You can now view 'my-scopes' components in the browser.
Bit server is running on http://localhost:3002
```

## Connect a scope to a workspace

To use your newly-created Remote Scope, configure it in the relevant Workspaces. Run the following, inside the Workspace directory:

```
bit remote add REMOTE_SCOPE_URL
```

For example:

```bash
cd my-workspace
bit remote add http://localhost:3001
```

:::info
The `bit remote add` command registers the Remote Scope URL in the Workspace's [Local Scope](/workspace/local-scope) config ([`scope.json`](/scope/configuring-scopes#remotes)).
:::

## Configure components to use a scope

A Remote Scope can be configured for a Workspace. This will set it as the default Remote Scope for Components in that Workspace.

```json
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
    "defaultScope": "my-scope"
  },
```

Alternatively, a Remote Scope can be configured on a specific Component or group of Components. To learn more see [Component configuration](/components/component-config).

To export Components to that Remote Scope, run `bit export`. For example:

```
$ bit export

exported the following 1 component(s):
my-scope/ui/heading
```

<Image src={scopeUiFull} />

## Publish Component Packages to npm

A Scope handles export and import operations. To make you components installable as packages (`npm install`/`bit install`) [configure them to be published to a package registry](/packages/publishing-components-to-commonjs-registries).

:::note Bit Cloud as a Package Registry
Components exported to Scopes hosted on Bit Cloud can be installed from Bit Cloud (no need for additional configuration).
