# Creating Scopes

Components can be collaborated on using Scopes hosted on Bit Cloud. This can be done quite easily as Bit offers built-in support for Bit Cloud.
If, however, you'd like to create Scopes and host them on your on server, this page is for you.

## Create your own Scope

When a [Workspace is initialized](/workspace/creating-workspaces#initialize-a-workspace-on-an-existing-project), a [Local Scope](/workspace/local-scope) (located in `.bit` or `.git/bit`) is initialized, as well. This scope is used by the [Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview), for its internal processes.

To create the Scope, without the rest of the Workspace (the working directory), use the `--bare` option (this Scope will be used by multiple Workspaces, and not just for the internal use of a single one).

```bash
mkdir my-scope
cd my-scope
bit init --bare
```

This will initialize a new Scope, and set the `name` property in its [`scope.json`](/workspace/local-scope#scope.json) to the name of its hosting directory (in this case `my-scope`).

## Start the Server

The server offers a UI that displays the exported components, and handles the `export`/`import` requests to the Scope.

```bash
bit start
```

```bash
Building UI assets for 'my-scope' in target directory: public/bit. The first time we build the UI it may take a few minutes.


You can now view 'my-scopes' components in the browser.
Bit server is running on http://localhost:3002
```

## Add your Scope to a Workspace

To use the newly-created Scope, configure it in the relevant Workspaces.

```bash
cd my-workspace
bit remote add http://localhost:3001 # scope url
```

This will update the Workspace's [Local Scope](/workspace/local-scope) config ([`scope.json`](/scope/configuring-scopes#remotes)).

## Configure a Workspaces to Use the Scope

Configure Workspaces to use your scope using the scope name.

```json
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
    "defaultScope": "my-scope"
  },
```

You can now export components to the new scope.

For example:

```
$ bit export

exported the following 1 component(s):
my-scope/ui/heading
```

<Image src={scopeUiFull} width="70%" />

## Publish Component Packages to npm

A Scope handles export and import operations. To make you components installable as packages (`npm install`/`bit install`) [configure them to be published to a package registry](/packages/publishing-components-to-commonjs-registries).

:::note Bit Cloud as a Package Registry
Components exported to Scopes hosted on Bit Cloud can be installed from Bit Cloud (no need for additional configuration).
