# Build Tasks

Build tasks are component development operations that are executed in sequence, in one or more build pipelines (build pipeline, snap pipeline, or tag pipeline).

The easiest way to start implementing a Build Task is by using the 'build-task' template:

```bash
bit create build-task modules/my-task
```

:::tip Fork a complete example

Fork an example build task component and edit it in your workspace:

```bash
bit fork teambit.pipelines/examples/modules/loc-stats
```

:::

## Name and register build task

To identify your build task in various outputs and logs, set task name (`name`). Since there may be various Aspects that may register the build task, we allow for instantiating it with an Aspect ID (`aspectId`) of the aspect that registered the task.

```ts
export class MyTask implements BuildTask {
  constructor(readonly aspectId: string) {}
  readonly name = 'MyBuildTask';
}
```

## Process relevant components

The build task receives the Build context (`context`) from the Builder aspect. The context provides data on all generated capsules in this instance of the build process.

Build tasks run on components, grouped by their Envs. This means that depending on the env, you will get different instance of capsules. For example, when the task runs over `teambit.react/react` Env's components, the capsules will only be for components that have the `teambit.react/react` Env configured.

Iterate over each capsule and run any operation for the component in the capsule.

```ts
  async execute(context: BuildContext): Promise<BuiltTaskResult> {
    const capsules = context.capsuleNetwork.seedersCapsules;
    capsules.forEach((capsule) => {
      console.log(`This component's name is: ${capsule.component.id.name}`);
    }
    return {
      // ...
    }
  }
```

:::tip About seeder capsules

In most cases, the Capsules you should care about are the 'Seeder Capsules' (`seedersCapsules`). These are the Capsules that are intentionally being built (others are for the dependent-components).

## Store component metadata

Build tasks must return data about the components they processed (`componentsResults`). This may be used for errors, start and end timestamps, etc.
When tasks are executed as part of the `snap` or `tag` processes, Bit persists the data as part of the snapshot.

```ts
  async execute(context: BuildContext): Promise<BuiltTaskResult> {
    // ...
    const componentsResults: ComponentResult[];
    const capsules = context.capsuleNetwork.seedersCapsules;
    capsules.forEach((capsule) => {
      componentsResults.push(capsule.component)
    }
    return {
      componentsResults,
    };
  }
```

## Save New Artifacts in the Component Artifacts

The artifacts your build task generates can be persisted in the component version. Select the relevant artifacts using a glob pattern, and set a description for them (non-selected artifacts will not be persisted).

A single task may return more than a single set of artifacts. In that case, the name (`name`) given for them should distinguish one set of artifacts from another (for example, a single compilation task that generates code transpiled to 'ES2015' and 'ES2020' standards)

```ts
  async execute(context: BuildContext): Promise<BuiltTaskResult> {
  // ...
    return {
      artifacts: [
        {
          generatedBy: this.aspectId,
          name: `component snapshots`,
          globPatterns: [`snapshots/**`],
        },
      ],
      componentsResults,
    };
  }
```
