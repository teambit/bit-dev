# Development Services

[Environments](/envs/envs-overview) run various commands and workflows on components, such as compilation, testing and linting. These workflows are implemented in a set of internal tools called **Development Services**, which may use other tools to accomplish a wanted task.

Dev-Services define how different workflows and commands get executed. While Bit offers a set of predefined and implemented Development Services, you can use this capability to expand Bit to support additional workflows. Use it to either add new tooling support for existing workflows or to add new workflows to Bit.

:::tip Small workflow adjustments

Small modifications like applying a different config or adding a build task does not require a new Environment Service.

- To apply your own configuration head over to the specific service documentation and see how to achieve that.
- Read more on how to [add a task to your build pipeline](/dev-services-overview/builder//dev-services-overview/builder/implement-build-task).

## Adding New Tooling

Adding new tooling is about implementing the interface defined by an Environment Service. You only need to provide the specific implementation of the API to run tasks related to the tool.  
When extending Bit you always start by creating an [Aspect](/extending-bit/aspect-overview), in this case the aspect will implement the require interface by your target env-service and use any tool to run complex operations.

Development Services provide templates for you to get stated with the APIs you need to implement. Start by using any of the templates:

```bash
bit create compiler my-new-compiler-service
```

See all available env-services bundled with Bit [here](/dev-services-overview/available-services).

## Adding a New Workflow

Env-services are [Bit Aspect](/extending-bit/aspect-overview) that implement the `EnvService` interface.  
By implementing this interface, envs can run the task implemented in the env-service on components. Bit provides a template to get started with creating your own env-service.

```bash
bit create env-service my-new-env-service
```

When building an env-service, you can already compose it to your environment locally for testing.

While there are no limitations on the implementation details for your env-service it is recommended to follow some guidelines to allow other developers using your env-service to extend and support future tooling and flows your env-service enables.

### Service handlers

Service Handler is an API for the Environment to pass data and use a specific env-service. The API may support passing configuration, tools, or anything needed by the env-service. It is the only integration point between an environment maintainer and you, for them to compose your env-service to their workflow.

For example, we can create a Service Handler call `getCompiler()` to configure the Compiler Env Service to run the Babel aspect. The `getCompiler()` method can accept configuration or any parameter for customizing the compiler.

### Integrating with aspects

You may want to extend your env-service functionality to create a new CLI command, write to Bit's, generate and manage artifacts, etc. All of this is possible by depending and using core aspects. You may also integrate your env-service with other env-services, as needed.

### Execution in the workspace VS execution during build

While build tasks run in isolation during `tag` or `snap` on the **component capsule**, env-services may run operations directly in a workspace. This is useful when you have a tool that does extensive and slow work for validating quality of a component, but also supports a "lightweight" run so not to slow down the workflow.

When you build your own env-server, always consider developer experience and performance. Try not to have slow operations run in the workspace.
