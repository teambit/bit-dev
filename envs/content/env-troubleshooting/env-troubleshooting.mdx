# Envs Troubleshooting

## Multiple Envs applied on a single component

Incorrect component configuration may lead to having multiple Envs applied on a single component. This is not allowed as each component may only use a single Env at a time.

This issue can be found by running `bit status`.

For example:

```bash
$ bit status

     > pages/welcome ...  issues found
       multiple envs (remove the old envs by setting them with "-" sign in the variants. see https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/aspects/variants#removing-aspects ):
          company.scope/envs/my-react, teambit.react/react
```

### Bad config example

In the example below, the `pages/welcome` component is selected an applied with an Env, twice.

First, it is selected using the `*` wildcard, and set to use the `teambit.react/react` env.

Secondly, it is selected using the `"{pages/**}"` namespace glob pattern, and set to use the `company.scope/envs/my-react` Env.

```json title="Bad config: Envs should be applied on mutually exclusive groups. Instead, they overlap."
{
  //...
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "*": {
      "teambit.react/react": {}
    },
    "{pages/**}": {
      "company.scope/envs/my-react": {}
    },
}
```

### Solution #1: Use the exclude selector

Exclude the subgroup of components selected with `{pages/**}` from the group of component selected using the `"*"` selector.
This is done using the selection negator `!`.

```json title="Solution #1: Exclude the overlapped group of components"
{
  //...
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "*, !{pages/**}": {
      "teambit.react/react": {}
    },
    "{pages/**}": {
      "company.scope/envs/my-react": {}
    },
}
```

### Solution #2: Explicitly set an Env

Set the Env to use by configuring the `teambit.envs/envs` Aspect.

```json
"{pages/**}": {
  // Use the env as an Aspect dependency
  "company.scope/envs/my-react": {},
  // explicitly configure it as an Env
  "teambit.envs/envs": {
    "env": "company.scope/envs/my-react"
  }
},
```

:::note
This solution will not remove the `"teambit.react/react"` from being an aspect dependency of the `pages/**` components.
So, unless you need both aspects to be applied on this group of components, it's better to use one of the other methods.
:::

### Solution #3: Explicitly remove an Env

Use the `-` to explicitly remove `teambit.react/react` as an Aspect dependency of that group of components.

```json title="Explicitly remove an Env"
"{pages/**}": {
  // Remove the default react env configured by the "*" selector
  "teambit.react/react": "-",
  // Use the custom env
  "company.scope/envs/my-react": {}
},
```

:::note
Aspects are copied to the component config from previously-tagged versions of it.
If your component was tagged previously with multiple Envs, or with a different Env, you need to remove it explicitly (by choosing 'Solution #3').<!-- TODO: add link to explanation about this -->
