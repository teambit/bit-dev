# Extending an Env

Envs in Bit are designed to be extendable and composable. When you want to define your workflow you don't need to start from scratch. Take any existing env and use it's programmatic APIs to tune it to your needs. The scope of changes and complexity is up to you: adding a single lint rule, changing the build pipeline or even adding a completely new workflow, and anything is between is possible.  
The env you extended will become a dependency for your setup, so you can keep get updates from it.

:::tip Just like any other component

A custom env is versioned and managed just like any other component. This allows a single-point of control for how you manage the build pipeline and workflow for other components.

:::

Envs provide templates to get started quickly with composing on top of them. To see list of available templates:

```bash
bit templates
```

Let's create a basic env that composes one of the base envs:

```bash
bit create react-env envs/my-env
```

The template generates the following component:

```bash
scope/my-env
├── index.ts
├── jest
│   └── jest.config.js
├── my-env.aspect.ts
├── my-env.docs.mdx
├── my-env.main.runtime.ts
├── my-env.preview.runtime.ts
├── typescript
│   └── tsconfig.json
└── webpack
    └── webpack-transformers.ts
```

All env-templates define the generated envs with configuration for "being" a Component Development Environment. Validate by running `show` for the component.

```bash
bit show company.scope/envs/my-env
```

Look for the `teambit.envs/env` setting.

```bash
┌───────┬───────────────────────────┐
│ id    │ company.scope/envs/my-env │
├───────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ ...   │ ...                       │
├───────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ env   │ teambit.envs/env          │
└───────┴───────────────────────────┘
```

Get started with optimizing your flow by editing `*.main.ts`:

```javascript
import { MainRuntime } from '@teambit/cli';
import { ReactAspect, ReactMain } from '@teambit/react'; // Set a dependency on the env to extend
import { EnvsAspect, EnvsMain } from '@teambit/envs';
import { MyReactAspect } from './my-react.aspect';

export class MyReactMain {
  static slots = [];
  static dependencies = [ReactAspect, EnvsAspect];
  static runtime = MainRuntime;

  static async provider([react, envs]: [ReactMain, EnvsMain]) {
    const templatesReactEnv = envs.compose(react.reactEnv, [
      react.useTypescript( ),     // an API from the base env to change the functionality of the typescript compiler
      react.useEslint( ),         // an API from the base env to change the functionality of the eslint linter
    ]);
    envs.registerEnv(templatesReactEnv); // register the composed env
    return new MyReactMain();
  }
}

MyReactAspect.addRuntime(MyReactMain);
```

Once you apply any change, you can `tag` the first version of your component and export it.

```bash
bit tag company.scope/envs/my-env --message "first version"
bit export
```

## Using custom envs

Using custom envs is done just the same as pre-built envs, with the `bit env set` command:

```bash
bit env set acme.demo/welcome company.scope/envs/my-env      # define the component a custom env.
```

## Extending a custom env

The ability to extend a custom env is determined by the developer of the custom env, and if they added any API to customize their envs.
