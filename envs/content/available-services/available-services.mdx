## Available Dev-Services

Envs may be composed from various services. However, there are set services which are important for a basic component-workflow.

### Component preview

To preview all components in the workspace use the `start` command. It gets the preview for a per-component dev-server tooling and configuration from the env applied to the component.

```bash
bit start
```

```bash
ENVIRONMENT NAME                    URL                                          STATUS
teambit.react/react                 http://localhost:3300                        RUNNING
teambit.harmony/node                http://localhost:3301                        RUNNING

You can now view 'my workspace' components in the browser.
Bit server is running on http://localhost:3000
```

### Compilation

Compiling a component to a specific target format allows other components to `import` and depend on that component as a node module.

```bash
bit compile
```

```bash
  STATUS  COMPONENT ID
✔ SUCCESS templates/envs/my-react # Using the Aspect env which is set to use the `Babel` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/pages/welcome # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/ui/card       # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/ui/heading    # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/ui/text       # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS ui/my-welcome           # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.

✔ 6/6 components compiled successfully.
Finished. (3s)
```

Compile can run in watch mode as well:

```bash
bit watch
```

### Testing

Each component tests run in isolation from each other. All testing results are available through the CLI as well as part of the workspace UI.

```bash
bit test
```

```bash
testing total of 6 components in workspace 'my-workspace'
testing 5 components with environment company.scope/templates/envs/my-react

 PASS  ui/my-welcome/my-welcome.spec.tsx

```

### Linting

Depending on the environment configured on components, components in the same workspace may have different linting rules. Still, the operation itself is the same as all other services.

```bash
bit lint
```

:::note `list` is still a work-in-progress and suffers from performance issues.
:::

### Formatting

Depending on the environment configured on components, components in the same workspace may have different formatting rules. Still, the operation itself is the same as all other services.

```bash
bit format
```

### Build pipeline

Each component has its own build pipeline composed from various tasks.

```bash
bit build
```
