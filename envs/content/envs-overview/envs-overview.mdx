# Envs

An Env is a complete component development environment encapsulated as a single Component.
Envs provide development tools for your Components. These include tools for testing, compilation, documentation, visualization and more.

Components in the same Workspace can use different Envs for their development.
These can be Bit's official Envs like React Env and Angular Env, or they can be custom Envs, tailored specifically for your team.

An Env's development tools are never used directly, but through intermediates that standardize they way these tools are operated.
That way the same CLI commands and APIs can be used to generate similar results. 
For example, a single command like `bit compile`, compiles all Components in the Workspace, regardless of the specific Compiler their Envs use.

A component may only have a single env defined. Use the `env` command to see how components are configured:

```bash
bit env
```

```bash
┌──────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐
│ component                        │ env                             │
├──────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────┤

## Env is a component

Envs are implemented as [Bit Components](/docs/components/component-overview) that compose together different workflows ([env services](/docs/envs/env-service-overview)) and configs for testing, linting, formatting, previewing and others.  
Different envs may use the same flows but with different configuration. For example, **formatter** is used by both React and Angular, but each of them applies a different set of rules. Envs can provide APIs to be extended and composed to more concrete flows.

## Envs in your workspace

A Bit workspace helps you focus on components and removes all other noise such as configuration files. This is critical when working with many components, as this can quickly pollute your workspace with many config files.

An env encapsulates all the "noise" to single component. You then apply the env on a component for all flows and configs to apply for that specific component. In the same sense, you may also set vastly different envs on components in the same workspace.

```javascript
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{utility-functions/**}": {    // Match any component name starts with utility-functions
        "teambit.harmony/node": {} // Set "node" workflow and configs for components
    },
    "{pages/**}": {                // Match any component name starts with pages
        "teambit.react/react": {}  // Set "react" workflow and configs for components
    },
}
```

When you run different commands like `start`, `compile`, `test`, `lint`, `format` or `build`, the operation will run per-component, according to how it is set in the env applied to it.
