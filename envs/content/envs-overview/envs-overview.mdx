# Component Development Environment

Component Development Environments (envs) contains and manages development tools, configs and workflows (linter, compiler, tester, etc) and their configs.

Envs provides various services for developers to control component life-cycle and development, starting from generating components with templates, through compilation, all the way to deployment. It has several benefits:

- Single, versioned place that defines and controls workflows, configs and tools for one "type" of components.
- Envs provide APIs for others to customized and use as a baseline when defining more concrete setups.
- The same workspace may have components using different envs, meaning you can work on Angular and React components in the same workspace.
- No configuration files polluting your codebase, no matter how complex your setup is, and how many components you have.
