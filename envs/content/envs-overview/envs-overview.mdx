# Envs

Envs are reusable development environments for components. They are used simplify and standardize component development workflows, like **compilation**. You may set different envs on different "types" of components. It means that a single command runs the same flow for all components in the workspace, regardless of specific tools or configs used.

An env contains the definition for how a component is built and maintained. By setting a specific env on a component you define the component "type": React, Angular or Node, as each requires a different setup.  
You can build envs to contain more granular configurations for having various flavors of components of the same "type". For example, keeping a different env just for React Hooks, which extends your base React configuration.

A component may only have a single env defined. Use the `env` command to see how components are configured:

```bash
bit env
```

```bash
┌──────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐
│ component                        │ env                             │

## Env is a component

Envs are implemented as [Bit Components](/docs/components/component-overview) that compose together different workflows ([env services](/docs/envs/env-service-overview)) and configs for testing, linting, formatting, previewing and others.  
Different envs may use the same flows but with different configuration. For example, **formatter** is used by both React and Angular, but each of them applies a different set of rules. Envs can provide APIs to be extended and composed to more concrete flows.

## Envs in your workspace

A Bit workspace helps you focus on components and removes all other noise such as configuration files. This is critical when working with many components, as this can quickly pollute your workspace with many config files.

An env encapsulates all the "noise" to single component. You then apply the env on a component for all flows and configs to apply for that specific component. In the same sense, you may also set vastly different envs on components in the same workspace.

When you run different commands like `start`, `compile`, `test`, `lint`, `format` or `build`, the operation will run per-component, according to how it is set in the env applied to it.  
Checkout all available services [here](/docs/dev-services/available-services). And if you need to create your own, follow this [guide](/docs/envs/creating-your-own-services).
