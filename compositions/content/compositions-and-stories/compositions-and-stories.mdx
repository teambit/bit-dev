# Compositions and Stories (Storybook)

Compositions and [Stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story) can appear quite similar. Almost like two sibling solutions that solve the same problem.

Compositions could be used as a way to examine components in a context-free environment (much like Storybook is often used), however that is not their main goal.
Compositions are primarily used as simulated integration tests. They are a way to validate that a component is able to integrate successfully in its future consuming projects (before sharing it).

Moreover, unlike stories, compositions are not limited to UI components. They are often used to visualize the behavior of a logical components.

## Setting up Storybook in a Bit workspace

### Initialize Storybook

Since Bit workspaces do not use a `package.json`, Storybook is unable to determine, by itself, the type of components in the project.

Use Storybook's `--type` option to manually set the type of components, when initializing Storybook. For example:

```bash title="Example: Initializing SB for React"
$ npx sb init --type react
```

:::note
An alternative to manually configuring Storybook would be to initialize a `package.json` and install the dependencies (like, react) that will help Storybook understand the project requirements.

### Manage Storybook dependencies

Storybook dependencies listed in the generated `package.json` file can either be moved to the `workspace.jsonc` (nested in the Dependency Resolver's policy property), or remain in their `package.json` file. Either way, `bit install` will know to read them and install them accordingly.

### Set Story files as dev files

Stories are only used for development and not for runtime. Configure the `devFilePatterns` property of the Dependency Resolver, to consider any dependency of this type as a dev dependency.

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
// workspace.jsonc

{
  // ...
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    // ...
    "devFilePatterns": ["**/*.spec.ts", "**/*.stories.tsx"]
  }
}
```

### Load stories from component directories

Set the `.storybook/main.js` file, in the workspace directory, to use a glob pattern that fits the way components are structured in a Bit workspace, i.e, one directory for each component.

```js title=".storybook/main.js"
// .storybook/main.js

module.exports = {
  stories: ['../demo/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'],
  // ...
};
```

### Create a Story

Create Stories in story files inside their corresponding component directory.

For example:

```bash
└── heading
    ├── heading.composition.tsx
    ├── heading.docs.mdx
    ├── heading.module.scss
    ├── heading.spec.tsx
    ├── heading.stories.tsx
    ├── heading.tsx
    └── index.ts
```

## Use Compositions in a Story

```ts title="card.stories.tsx"
// card.stories.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { Card } from './card';
import { BasicCard } from './card.composition';

export default {
  title: 'UI/Card',
  component: Card,
};

export const BasicCardStory = () => <BasicCard />;
```

```ts title="card.compositions.tsx"
// card.compositions.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { Card } from './card';

export const BasicCard = () => (
  <Card
    link="https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/reference/bit-oss-server"
    heading="Self Host"
    text="lean how to self host these components"
  />
);
```

## Use a Story in Compositions

```ts title="card.composition.tsx"
// card.composition.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { BasicCard } from './card.stories';

export const BasicCardComposition = () => <BasicCard />;
```

```ts title="card.stories.tsx"
// card.stories.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { Card } from './card';

export default {
  title: 'UI/Card',
  component: Card,
};

export const BasicCard = () => (
  <Card
    link="https://harmony-docs.bit.dev/reference/bit-oss-server"
    heading="Self Host"
    text="lean how to self host these components"
  />
);
```

## Limitations

### Collaboration

Storybook is designed for projects. Its configurations are set globally on all components in the project.
That means, collaboration on [the components'] stories must also be done using their workspace as "the project". They cannot be maintained independently (in other workspaces) as the Storybook config is not part of the components' metadata.

### Multiple Envs

Bit Workspaces are not limited to just one Env. A single workspace can, for instance, maintain both React an Angular components. A single Storybook workspace, on the other hand, is not able to process and render components of different types.

:::note title="Storybook Compositions"
['Storybook Compositions'](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/workflows/storybook-composition) are a way to render multiple Storybook workspaces in the same UI. This can be used (although not recommended) to initialize multiple Storybook workspaces in a single Bit workspace, and render them in a single UI.
