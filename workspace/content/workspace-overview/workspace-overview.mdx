# Workspace Overview

The Bit Workspace is a component-driven development workspace, allowing to implement and compose loosley-coupled, independent components into systems. Every
component in the Bit workspace is independent, to the same degree a Git repo is. It is dynamic development workspace that allows to import component and export components from
it for everyone to use. 

Teams and individuals can resort to a decoupled codebase, containing only the components they are maintaining, exporting them as APIs for others to use. Components can easily
be moved between Workspaces.

## Monorepo / Polyrepo




A Bit Workspace enables the development and composition of loosely-coupled, independent components.
It is like a component-level Monorepo which provides a dev experience similar to building regular apps using tools like CRA, Next.JS and others.

Workspaces are used for building and maintaining Component Libraries, Apps or Modules. <!--TODO [Component Libraries](/), [Apps](/), [Modules](/) -->

## Workspace Anatomy

A Bit workspace has a minimal footprint on the codebase. It requires only two files to manage components.
 
- `.bitmap` - Mapping of Component IDs to the Components' location in the filesystem (in the workspace directory).
- `workspace.jsonc` - Main file for the Workspace configuration.

:::note
Component versions are located in the [local scope](/local-scope).
:::

## Flexible Directory Structure

A Bit Workspace is a monorepo that supports nesting Components in sub-directories. You can build a highly-nested structure for your workspace, a flat structure, or decide where in your project you want deep nesting and where you don't.

By Default, Bit aims to create symmetry between component scoping and name-spacing on the one side, and the workspace directory structure, on the other.

```sh title="Components in workspace sorted according to functionality"
├── cart
│   ├── purchase-summary
│   └── shopping-cart
└── design
    ├── ui
    │   ├── button
    │   └── card   // for example, the corresponding component ID: my-org.design/ui/button
    └── theme
        ├── color-pallet
        └── theme-context
```

This default behavior aims to improve the discovery experience for components in your codebase. The structure is not rigid. You can move components around as needed, or create and sort them in any way you see fit; as above, the bitmap file enables bit to track components wherever they are in your workspace.

## Components as a Directories

Bit requires each component's files to be contained in a single directory in the Workspace. This directory includes the component's code, stylings, tests, documentation, etc and an `index` main (entry) file for all exports.

```sh title="Basic component directory"
└── shopping-cart
    ├── index.ts
    ├── shopping-cart.composition.tsx
    ├── shopping-cart.docs.mdx
    ├── shopping-cart.spec.tsx
    └── shopping-cart.tsx
```

:::note
You can keep sub-directories to sort internal files as needed. So you could put `shopping-cart.spec.tsx` in a `tests` folder for instance.
:::

This structure has several benefits:

- Directory structure is easily consumable by placing all the related files together.
- File references become shorter and more read-friendly.
- Easy to move components around in the workspace.
- Simple refactoring workflow, as changes are consolidated to the same place.
- `index` is a single point for consumers and maintainers to start from when doing any operation on the component.

## Different Component Types in a Single Workspace

Bit workspaces allow you to maintain components of different types and frameworks.
Since each component is isolated and be built independently using its configured Env, a single workspace can easily include both Angular modules, React components, Node modules or any other type of components you might need.

## Workspace UI

All components in your workspace are rendered and presented on a local development server. To start it, run the following command:

```sh
bit start
```

<Image src={wsScreenshot} />

:::note
By default, Bit generates a local build for the dev server in the `public/bit` directory.

## Component Module Links

Bit creates a module in the [workspace's] `node_modules` directory, for each component in the workspace. That includes components that haven't been exported, yet.
Each module contains the compiled code of its corresponding component, as well as symlinks to its source files.

```
└── node_modules
    └── @my-org
        └── my-scope.ui.card
            ├── card.composition.tsx -> ~/my-workspace/my-scope/ui/card/card.composition.tsx
            ├── card.docs.mdx -> ~/my-workspace/my-scope/ui/card/card.docs.mdx
            ├── card.spec.tsx -> ~/my-workspace/my-scope/ui/card/card.spec.tsx
            ├── card.tsx -> ~/my-workspace/my-scope/ui/card/card.tsx
            ├── dist
            │   ├── card.composition.js
            │   ├── card.composition.js.map
            │   ├── card.docs.mdx
            │   ├── card.js
            │   ├── card.js.map
            │   ├── card.spec.js
            │   ├── card.spec.js.map
            │   ├── index.js
            │   └── index.js.map
            ├── index.ts -> ~/my-workspace/demo/ui/card/index.ts
            └── package.json
```

When consuming one component in another component, even in the same workspace, these modules are used as absolute paths.

```jsx
import { Card } from '@my-org/my-scope.ui.card';
```

By using module links in `import` statements you treat all dependencies as regular npm packages (which they are), thereby decoupling the component's implementation from the project's file structure, making the component transferable.

By default, `bit install` links all components tracked in your Workspace.

```bash
bit install
```

To link all components you can use:

```bash
bit link
```

## Workspace Dependency Graph

Bit keeps a dependency graph representing all components in the workspace according to their `import` statements.

When you make any change to a component, Bit finds all its dependents and runs operations on them recursively. This is to ensure that not only your modified component works and updates as expected, but that all components affected from the change are updated and validated too.

This also helps save time and resources by building (or testing) only affected components.

## Centralized Component Management

A Workspace serves as the main interface for managing components. Bit uses the configurations and actions carried out in the workspace to manage Components.

### Component Configuration

In an effort to keep the workspace clean of any unwanted configuration files and focus only on code, there's no `package.json` required for each Bit Component. Instead use the workspace to manage a set of configuration rules and policies that Bit then applies on each component.

### Per-component Versioning

A Bit Component has its own versioning history and changelog. The Bit Workspace supports this workflow by versioning only modified components.  
In a similar way to how Bit builds only affected components, it recursively finds all affected components (i.e. dependents), and promotes their `patch` version.

### Dependency Policy

Any component in your workspace can `import` any of the dependencies available in the workspace. Moreover, a package which is a `dependency` for one component may be a `devDependency` for another. Instead of having to manually define dependencies per component, the Workspace calculates dependencies for each component according to its respective list of `import`s. And per dependency, it's dependency type is decided by the file/s requesting it.

The workspace's policy also allows setting different versions of the same dependencies for different components in the same workspace, via the variants section.
