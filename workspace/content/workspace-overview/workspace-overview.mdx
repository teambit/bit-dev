# Workspace Overview

The Bit Workspace allows development and composition of loosely-coupled, independent components together in a component driven fashion.
It is like a next-gen Monorepo, that provides a monolithic dev experience for building independent components and composing them into various features and apps.

You can think of the Bit Workspace as a "dynamic repository", components can be imported to it, and exported from it.

## Simple

## Distributed

## Scalable
A Bit workspace can easily maintain hunderds of different independent components.

## Modular

## Maintain components of any type
In the Bit workspace you can maintain components from different types and frameworks. Since each component is isolated and be built independently using its configured development
environment, a single workspace can easily include both Angular modules, React components, Node modules or any other type of components you might need.

## Works on any project
A Bit Workspace can be initialized on any project. From CRA, Next.js and all the way to Monorepo tools like Lerna and NX.
