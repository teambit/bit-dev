# Workspace Overview

<ComponentCardDisplay componentIds={[
  'teambit.workspace/workspace',
]} style={{ float: 'left', margin: 20, maxWidth: 250 }} />

The Bit Workspace is made for distributed, component-driven software, where each component is independently versioned.
Bit's Workspaces are making it wea. You can create new components, use existing components, 
modify existing components, and export new and existing components - all from the same workspace. 

They also allow for the development of all types of components.

Get started and generate a demo workspace:

```bash
bit new react demo
```

## Component development server

All components in your workspace are rendered and presented on a local development server. To start it, run the following command:

```sh
bit start
```

## Simple, scalable dev experience

Keeping a similar dev-experience across workspaces allows you to jump in and out of codebases. When you don't need to deal with a per-project setup or learn the workflow commands/scripts you simply focus on the code.

Simple dev experience means you can **easily onboard** yourself to a workspace, thanks to:

- **Use the same commands** - Regardless of the tooling and configs used in a workspace, you use the same commands (`compile`, `test`, etc) and get similarly structured outputs.
- **Minimal configuration** - Most of the configuration and setup is automated. No need to define per-component dependencies and no additional files needed to change a component's build pipeline.
- **Templates and standards** - Create new components with templates and apply your formatting, linting, compilation and testing standards with a single policy.
- **Components are directories** - Each [component in your workspace is a directory](/workspace/component-directory) so relevant files, assets and tests available in a single place.

This makes it easy to scale the amount of components in a workspace, scale the amount of workspaces and even scale the amount of developers!

## Composition of components

Import any component and get a monolithic-like developer experience with ability to refactor many components in a single place. The workspace takes care of managing each component as an independent item with its own implementation, history and config ([read more](/components/component-overview)).  
This allows you to be flexible with how you structure a workspace and its contents. For example, you can [import a component](/components/importing-components) from anywhere and work on it, just like you built it in your workspace.

```bash
bit import teambit.community/ui/graph/bubble-graph
```

Bit adds the new component to the list of components in the workspace, pulls down the complete revision history, configs and dependencies. Now you can do local modifications, see the component when running `bit start`, and maintain it as if you implemented it in your own workspace.

In the same sense you can `export` and even `eject` any of your components from a workspace, and more it to another one. So if you started with building all components in the same place, you are not locked to that decision.

### Personalize your workspace

With composability in mind you can personalize your workspace on a per-feature basis or on the work you are currently focused on. You can start your flow by using `bit import` and fetch all required components, starting to modify and work on them as needed.  
When done, you can version and eject unneeded components. Instead of you working within the boundaries of your workspace, the workspace fits to your current work.

## Configuration-less

Regardless of the amount of components you have in your workspace, and how different they may be in their configuration, it only requires two files to manage components.

- `workspace.jsonc` - Contains the configuration policy for all components in the workspace.
- `.bitmap` - Maps Bit components to their corresponding location (directory) in the workspace.

With both these files, you track where each component is located and can apply configuration from a centralized location, according to various [`variant`](/workspace/variants) rules. The workspace then calculates the configuration to apply on a per-component basis.

The end result is a clean workspace where you have a minimal amount of configuration files, no matter how many components you have and their variants.

## Any dev environment, any framework

Angular modules, React components, Node modules or any other type of components you might need are rendered with the same [workspace UI](/workspace/workspace-ui), compiled by the same `compile` command, etc.  
You can maintain components of different types and frameworks in a Bit workspace, as each component has its own configured [Component Development Environment](/envs/envs-overview), which the workspace uses to run various workflows.

## Components in the workspace

A Bit Workspace manages many components. It aims to create symmetry between component naming and the directory structure.

```sh
├── cart
│   ├── purchase-summary
│   └── shopping-cart
└── design
    ├── ui
    │   ├── button
    │   └── card   // for example, the corresponding component ID: my-org.design/ui/button
    └── theme
        ├── color-pallet
        └── theme-context
```

:::tip The structure is not rigid. You can sort components however you see fit.
:::

For each component Bit generates a link in the root `node_modules` directory according to the component ID. It contains the compiled output of a component.

```bash
└── node_modules
    └── @my-org
        └── my-scope.ui.card
```

Use these modules when consuming one component in another, even in the same workspace.

```jsx
import { Card } from '@my-org/my-scope.ui.card';
```

:::info Absolute import statements decouple a component from the project's file structure.
:::

## Dependency policy

The workspace dependency policy defines how external dependencies are installed and their versions. The Bit workspace even supports setting different version of the same external dependency to different components.

Bit automates dependency management for each component. With a single policy for the workspace, Bit will deduce which version of which dependency to define for a component just by looking at the component's `import` and `require` statements. Dependency types like `dependency` and `devDependency` are automated, as they are contextual for each component, depending on how and where a dependency is used.

## Performance

Bit workspace is optimized to provide a quick feedback loop on code changes. It leaves the tough work of ensuring de-coupling and isolation to a more robust CI flow.

To optimize performance even further, any time you change a component, Bit will find which components are affected by the change. Bit then builds your modified components and their affected dependents.

## Integrate to existing codebases

Bit is a build tool that allows you to manage independent components. You may create a Bit workspace in a fresh directory or initialize one as part of an existing repository.  
You can get started working on independent components alongside projects built with [Angular](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt0), [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev) and even [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org).

`cd` to a pre-existing repository and run:

```bash
bit init
```

From here you may use any Bit command and flow to build independent components and integrate them into your application.
