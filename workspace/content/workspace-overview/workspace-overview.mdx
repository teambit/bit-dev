# Workspace Overview

The Bit Workspace allows development and composition of loosely-coupled, independent components together in a component driven fashion.
It is like a next-gen Monorepo, that provides a monolithic dev experience for building independent components and composing them into various features and apps.

You can think of the Bit Workspace as a "dynamic repository", components can be imported to it, and exported from it.

- Simple
- Distributed
- Fast

## Simple


## Distributed
Workspaces are distributed and can include and maintain any subset of compnents, regardless to the specific tech stack used for their implementation.

## Scalable
A Bit workspace can easily maintain hunderds of different independent components under the same workspace in high performance.

## Maintain components of any type
In the Bit workspace you can maintain components from different types and frameworks. Since each component is isolated and be built independently using its configured development
environment, a single workspace can easily include both Angular modules, React components, Node modules or any other type of components you might need. 

## Code sharing and collboration
The Bit workspace is optimized for extreame code sharing and collaboration. Components can be easily consumed or changed from any Workspace, without distributing the development
workflow and switching contexts.

## Component linking
Components are being linked to ensure consistent consumption across component maintainers and consumers.

## Works on any project
A Bit Workspace can be initialized on any project. From CRA, Next.js and all the way to Monorepo tools like Lerna and NX.

## Workspace UI
Bit comes with a built-in Workspace UI which allows the develpment of independent components in isolation, including previewing their test results, configuration and 
documantation prior to sharing them.
