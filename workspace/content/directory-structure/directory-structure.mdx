# Directory structure

The Workspace's directory structure is entirely up to you.

Run the following to track any [Component Directory](/workspace/component-directory) inside your Workspace directory:

```bash
bit add RELATIVE_PATH_TO_COMPONENT_DIRECTORY
```
When you create a new component (`bit create`) or import a component (`bit import`), that component is placed somewhere in your Workspace.
You can define a pattern that describes the directory path (where these Components will be placed) using placeholders that reference different sections of the Component ID.

The placeholders are as following:

- `scope`: The scope name
- `name`: The component full name, including its namespaces
- `componentName`: The component name without its namespaces
- `namespaces`: The component's Namespaces

For example:

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}"
  }
}
```

Say you imported a component by running the following command (while using the above configuration):

```bash
bit import teambit.base-ui/theme/fonts/book
```

This component will be placed in the `base-ui/ui/inputs/button` path (where `button` is the component directory).

It is recommended to maintain a symmetry between the components' namespaces and scopes on one side, and the directory structure, on the other.
In this symmetry, scopes are the top-level directories. This sort of structure helps in preserving team boundaries and ownership over Components in your Workspace. 

For example:

```bash
├── base-ui # corresponds to the 'teambit.base-ui' scope
    ├── ui  # corresponds to the 'ui' namespace
        ├── inputs # corresponds to the 'inputs' namespace ('ui/inputs')
          ├── button # corresponds to the component name
            ├── index.ts
            ├── button.tsx
            ├── button.spec.tsx
            ├── button.docs.mdx
            ├── ...
```
