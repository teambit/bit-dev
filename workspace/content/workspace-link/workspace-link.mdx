# Workspace component link

Workspace Component Links standardize the way components are consumed across Workspaces and repositories.

They enable Components to be consumed from the `node_modules` directory, using an absolute path that remains the same regardless of the Component's physical location, or whether it is imported as a Component or installed as a package.

<!-- Workspace Component Links ensure consistency for using a Component from different Workspaces and repositories. It what allows to use a [Component](/components/overview) in any [Workspace](/workspace/overview) regardless to it being a [Workspace Component](/workspace/workspace-component) or an installed package, through a module require path, consuming the same distribution target.  -->

```js
import { Button } from '@my-org/base-ui.ui.button';
```

Workspace links are generated in the `node_modules` directory and are composed of three main elements:

- A generated [package.json](/packages/package-json) file.
- Symlinked files that reference to the Component's source files (placed in the [Component Directory](/workspace/component-directory)). These symlinked source files are crucial for Workspace type resolution by type systems like TypeScript.
- A `dist` directory that includes the compiled code generated by the [Workspace Compiler](/compiler/workspace-compiler) and referenced by the generated [package.json](/packages/package-json).

          ├── package.json -> generated package.json for the component. main is pointing to dist directory.

Workspace Component Links are generated in the `node_modules` directory using `bit link`.

```bash
bit link
```
