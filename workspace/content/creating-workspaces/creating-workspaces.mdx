# Creating a Workspace

## Create a new Workspace using a template

Create a new Workspace using a template that best suits your future Components.
Each template provides, among other things, specific [Workspace configuration](/workspace/workspace-configuration). This configuration includes the Envs, Aspects and dependencies to use in that Workspace.

Run the following to list all available templates:

```bash
bit templates
```

:::note Workspace templates VS Component templates
Run `bit template` outside of a Workspace to list all available templates. Run `bit template` inside a Workspace to list all available Component templates.
:::

Run the following to generate a Workspace using a template:

```bash
bit new TEMPLATE_NAME WORKSPACE_NAME
```

For example, to create a Workspace using the React template, run the following:

```ts
bit new react my-react-workspace
```

This generates the following files and directories:

- `.bitmap`: The [mapping of Components](/workspace/bitmap) to their corresponding [Component Directory](/workspace/component-directory) in the filesystem.
- `workspace.jsonc`: The [Workspace configuration](/workspace/workspace-configuration) file.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` A lock file generated by [pnpm](/tools/pnpm/pnpm). pnpm is the [package manager](/dependencies/package-managers) configured for this workspace.
- `node_modules`: [A directory for every consumable module](/dependencies/node-modules) in this Workspace. This includes [External Dependencies](/dependencies/external-dependencies) as well as [Workspace Components Links](/workspace/component-link).
- `demo`: Demo Components.
- `tsconfig.json, .eslintrc, ...`: Config files to be used by your IDE, for a better dev ex.
- `.git`: A newly-initialized git repository. This is used to source-control the entire Workspace, excluding the Component versions which are stored in the [Local Scope](/workspace/local-scope) (see the `.gitignore` file).
- `.git/bit`: The [Local Scope](/workspace/local-scope). This scope is used internally by this Workspace.

## Initialize a Workspace on an existing project

A Bit project can be initialized on any project (including an empty one). Use this option to gradually migrate your project to Bit's component-driven paradigm.

At the root of your project's directory, run the following:

```bash
bit init
```

This creates the following files at the root of your project:

- `.bitmap`: The [mapping of Components](/workspace/bitmap) to their corresponding [Component Directory](/workspace/component-directory) in the filesystem.
- `workspace.jsonc`: The [Workspace configuration](/workspace/workspace-configuration) file.
- `.git/bit`: The [Local Scope](/workspace/local-scope). This scope is used internally by this Workspace.
