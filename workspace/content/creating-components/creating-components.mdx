# Creating Components

Components are created using the `bit create <template-name> <component-name>` command.

:::tip Bit Component Templates
When creating new Components inside of an existing Workspace, Bit offers several templates to choose from. To learn more about the different templates available, run `bit templates`.

If we wanted to create a React component with the name of button, we would run `bit create react button`.

For example:

```bash
bbit create react button
1 component(s) were created

my-scope/button
    location: my-scope/button
    env:      teambit.react/react
```

By default, the newly created component will appear in the Workspace in the same directory as the name of its Scope. You can modify the name of the Scope in the Workspace [`.bitmap`](/workspace/structure/bitmap) file. In our case, the scope was called `my-scope`, so the button Component was generated at my-scope/button.

If we want to create a Component within a specific directory in the Scope, for example, in a 'ui' directory, we can run `bit create react ui/button`.

```bash
bbit create react ui/button
1 component(s) were created

my-scope/button
    location: my-scope/ui/button
    env:      teambit.react/react
```
