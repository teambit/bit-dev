# Create Components

When you create a component you generate its initial source files and add its component ID to the [.bitmap file](/workspace/bitmap).

Components can be of various types such as, React, Angular, NodeJS, and others. The type of each component is determined by the Env it uses.

## Create Components using a template

Bit's official Envs offer Component templates to help you create new components. Run the following command inside your Workspace directory to list all available component templates:

```bash
bit templates
```

The output is similar to the following (it may also include templates provided by custom Envs in your Workspace):

```
teambit.react/react
    react (a basic react component)
    react-context (a react context component)
    react-hook (a react hook component)
    react-env (customize the base React env with your configs and tools)

teambit.harmony/node
    node-env (customize the base Node env with your configs and tools)
    module (a general purpose node module)

teambit.harmony/aspect
    aspect (extend Bit capabilities)

teambit.mdx/mdx
    mdx (Content component)
```

Run the following to create a component using one of these templates:

```bash
bit create COMPONENT_TEMPLATE COMPONENT_NAME [--scope SCOPE_NAME]
```

For example, run the following to create a React component:

```bash
bit create react ui/my-welcome
```

A [Component Directory](/workspace/component-directory) is generated with the following files:

- `index.ts` / [Component main file](/components/main-file), exposing the component API.
- `my-welcome.tsx` / Implantation of the React component. You can add as many files as required for your Component to operate.
- `my-welcome.spec.tsx` / [Tests](/tester/overview) file for the Component.
- `my-welcome.compositions.tsx` / [Compositions](/compositions/overview) file helping to simulate and visualize the component in different states.
- `my-welcome.docs.md` / [Docs](/docs/overview) file. A markdown file for documenting the component.


The Component's Env is not determined by the templated it used, but by the [Component Configuration](/components/component-config).
To learn more about configuring an Env see [Using Envs](//envs/using-env).

## Track existing directories as Components

Track an existing directory as a Component by running the following:

```bash
bit add COMPONENT_DIRECTORY_PATH [--namespace NAMESPACES] [--main COMPONENT_MAIN_FILE]
```

For example, to add the `ui/button` directory (using its relative path in the Workspace directory), and to name it with the `ui/inputs` namespaces, run the following:

```
bit add ui/button --namespaces ui/inputs
```

:::note Component entry file
A component's [main or entry file](/components/component-main-file) is `index.{t,j}s` by default. To set a different file use the `--main` option.
