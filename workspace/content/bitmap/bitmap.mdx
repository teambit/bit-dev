# .bitmap

`.bitmap` is a file auto-generated and managed by Bit in the [Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview) for mapping each component to its corresponding directory in the project's file system.
The `.bitmap` file is meant to be tracked and committed to the VCS repository (Git/Mercurial).

An example `.bitmap` file can be found in [this example project](https://github.com/bit-demos/ecommerce/blob/main/.bitmap).

:::note
Please note, the `.bitmap` file should not be manually changed by developers. Bit commands related to controlling the Workspace - such as `bit add`, `bit remove`, `bit create`, among others - take care of managing and updating `.bitmap`.

## Component entry

A Component entry in the `.bitmap` file is mapping a single component to is corresponding directory in the [Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview) file system.

For example:

```json
{
  "ui/avatar": {
    "scope": "deepblue.people",
    "version": "1.0.4",
    "mainFile": "index.ts",
    "rootDir": "people/ui/avatar"
  }
}
```

- `scope` / [Scope](/scope/scope-overview) owning the [Component](/components/component-overview).
- `version` / Current component version.
- `mainFile` / Component's [Main File](/components/component-main-file)
- `rootDir` / The [Component](/components/component-overview) root directory in the [Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview) file system.

## Schema Version

`.bitmap` files include a `$schema-version` property for Bit to be able to recognize potential breaking changes between developers using different Bit versions.

```json
{
  // ...
  "$schema-version": "14.9.0"
}
```
