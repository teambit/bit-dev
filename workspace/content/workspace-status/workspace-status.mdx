# Workspace Status

Bit' workspace track changes done to components, and shows the state of each in your project's workspace.
Understanding the state of the workspace's components during the development process can be essential and provides useful information to whether components are staged, modified 
or even have missing dependencies, syntax errors, or other potential issues.

A component may have more than one state. A state derived from its code status (such as modified) and a state derived from its dependencies (e.g. pending to be tagged).

Bit prompts component status on both the UI and the CLI. To quickly check your workspace status, use the `bit status` command.

```
$ bit status
```

You can also see component status on the Workspace UI component sidebar.

## States

### No changes or issues

No components have pending changes. Either no files are tracked in the workspace, or the tracked components have no pending changes.

```shell
bit status
```

```shell
nothing to tag or export
```

### New components

Components that have been tracked, but not yet tagged.

Bit tries to validate if a _new component_ can be isolated, and will print all isolation issues it finds (if any).

<!--TODO [Read more about the different isolation issues and how to resolve them](/add-and-isolate-components#isolation-errors). -->

```shell
bit status
```

```shell
new components
 (use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

 > bits/a ... ok
```

### Staged components

All tagged components that are ready to be [exported](/reference/cli-reference#export) and shared to a remote Collection.

In Git status terms, the equivalent would be changes which have been committed but not pushed to the server.

Staged components have been verified by Bit as fully isolated.

```shell
bit status
```

```shell
staged components
 (use "bit export <remote_collection> to push these components to a remote Collection")

 > string/index. versions: 0.0.1, 0.0.2, 0.0.3 ... ok
 > string/is-string. versions: 0.0.1 ... ok
 > string/pad-left. versions: 0.0.1, 0.0.2 ... ok
```

### Modified components

Components that have already been staged exported or sourced, and then modified - meaning there's at least one tagged version, and untagged changes on top of it.
Modified components are meant to be tagged and set as a new version.

Bit tries to validate if a _modified component_ can be isolated, and will print all isolation issues it finds (if any).

<!--TODO [Read more about the different isolation issues and how to resolve them](/add-and-isolate-components#isolation-errors). -->

```shell
bit status
```

```shell
modified components
 (use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)
 (use "bit diff" to compare changes)

> string/pad-left ... ok
```

### Pending updates

Components with newer versions fetched by `bit import` and available to use. Use [bit checkout](/reference/cli-reference#checkout) to start using the newer version.

```shell
bit status
```

```shell
pending updates
 (use "bit checkout [version] [component_id]" to merge changes)
 (use "bit diff [component_id] [new_version]" to compare changes)
 (use "bit log [component_id]" to list all available versions)

 > string/pad-left current: 0.0.1 latest: 0.0.2
```

### Deleted components

A component's files were physically deleted from the filesystem, but the component is still listed by Bit. The component should be removed using `bit remove <component-id>`.

```shell
bit status
```

```shell
deleted components
 these components were deleted from your project.
 use "bit remove [component_id]" to remove these component from your workspace

 > bits/b ... ok
```

### Component pending to be tagged automatically

Component (not in state new) for whom at least one of its dependencies is in `modified` state.

```shell
bit status
```

```shell
components pending to be tagged automatically (when their dependencies are tagged)
 > string/index ... ok
```
