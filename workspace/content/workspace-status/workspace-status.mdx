# Workspace Status

Bit notifies you of changes made to the Workspace's Components or to the Workspace's dependency graph.
Most importantly, it notifies you of any issues that need to be resolved.

Run the following to get the latest workspace status:

```
bit status
```

The output should be similar to:

```
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > envs/my-react ... ok
                         

modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)
(use "bit diff" to compare changes)

     > pages/welcome ... ok
     > elements/image ... ok
                         

staged components
(use "bit export <remote_scope> to push these components to a remote scope")

     > pages/welcome. versions: 0.0.1 ... ok
     > ui/card. versions: 0.0.1, 0.0.2 ... ok
     > ui/heading. versions: 0.0.1 ... ok
     > ui/text. versions: 0.0.1, 0.0.2 ... ok

```

:::info Workspace status in the UI
Part of the information available in terminal can be found in the Workspace UI. This information is constantly being updated.
Look for the notations ton the right of each component in the sidebar.
:::


## No changes or issues

```shell
nothing to tag or export
```

No components have pending changes. Either no files are tracked in the workspace, or the tracked components have no pending changes.

## New components
```shell
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > envs/my-react ... ok
```

New Components are Components that have been tracked, but have not yet tagged or snapped.

Bit to validate that a new Component can be isolated. It prints out all isolation issues if there are any.
Learn more about isolation issues and how to resolve them in [Isolation errors](/components/isolation-errors).


## Staged components
```shell
staged components
 (use "bit export <remote_collection> to push these components to a remote Collection")

 > string/index. versions: 0.0.1, 0.0.2, 0.0.3 ... ok
 > string/is-string. versions: 0.0.1 ... ok
 > string/pad-left. versions: 0.0.1, 0.0.2 ... ok
```

All tagged components that are ready to be [exported](/reference/cli-reference#export) and shared to a remote Collection.

In Git status terms, the equivalent would be changes which have been committed but not pushed to the server.

Staged components have been verified by Bit as fully isolated.

## Modified components

```bash
modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)
(use "bit diff" to compare changes)

     > pages/welcome ... ok
     > elements/image ... ok
                         
```

Components that have already been staged exported or sourced, and then modified - meaning there's at least one tagged version, and untagged changes on top of it.
Modified components are meant to be tagged and set as a new version.

Bit tries to validate that a _modified component_ can be isolated. It will print all [isolation issues](/components/isolation-errors) it finds any.

### Pending updates

```shell
pending updates
 (use "bit checkout [version] [component_id]" to merge changes)
 (use "bit diff [component_id] [new_version]" to compare changes)
 (use "bit log [component_id]" to list all available versions)

 > string/pad-left current: 0.0.1 latest: 0.0.2
```

Components with newer versions fetched by `bit import` and available to use. Use [bit checkout](/reference/cli-reference#checkout) to start using the newer version.

## Deleted components
```shell
deleted components
 these components were deleted from your project.
 use "bit remove [component_id]" to remove these component from your workspace

 > bits/b ... ok
```

A component's files were physically deleted from the filesystem, but the component is still listed by Bit. The component should be removed using `bit remove COMPONENT_ID`.

### Component pending to be tagged automatically

```shell
components pending to be tagged automatically (when their dependencies are tagged)
 > string/index ... ok
```

Component (that is not 'new') for whom at least one of its dependencies is in `modified` state.
