# Component Directory

A Component Directory is a directory for a Component in the [Workspace](/workspace/overview).
The mapping of Components to their directories can be found in the [.bitmap](/workspace/bitmap) file of your Workspace.

Every component directory must include _all_ its files, as well as a [Main File](/components/main-file) that exposes its API. The directory can be located anywhere in the Workspace, excluding only the [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directory and other Component Directories.

A Component Directory will often include the following files (with some variations, depending on the type of Component):

```bash
└── ui/hello-world # Component directory
    ├── index.ts # Main file
    ├── hello-world.tsx 
    ├── hello-world.spec.tsx # Tests
    ├── my-welcome.composition.tsx # Compositions for simulating the component in different states and contexts.
    └── my-welcome.docs.mdx # Documentation
```

This structure has several benefits:

- File references become shorter and more reader-friendly.
- Easy to move components around in the workspace.
- Simple refactoring workflow, as changes are consolidated to the same place.
- `index` is a single point for consumers and maintainers to start from when doing any operation on the component.

## Adding a directory as a Component

Tracking a directory as a Component can be done with the `bit add` command. For example:

```bash
bit add path/to/component-dir --id ui/my-component
```

<!--TODO To learn more on tracking components in the Workspace. Head over to the [Tracking Components section](/workspace/tracking-components). -->

## Removing a component directory

Removing a specific Component Directory in the Workspace can be achieved by using the `bit remove` command without the `--delete-files` flag which also removes the entire directory.

```bash
bit remove ui/my-welcome
```
