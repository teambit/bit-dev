# Component Directory

A Component Directory is a directory for a Component in the [Workspace](/workspace/overview). The mapping of Components to their directories can be found in the [.bitmap](/workspace/bitmap) file (see the `rootDir` property).

Every component directory must include a [Main File](/components/main-file) (an entry file). The directory can be located anywhere in the Workspace (directory), excluding only the [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directory and other Component Directories.

A common example component for a directory could be the following:

```bash
└── ui/my-welcome # Component directory
    ├── index.tsx # Entry file.
    ├── my-welcome.tsx # Main file.
    ├── my-welcome.spec.tsx # Test file.
    ├── my-welcome.composition.tsx # Compositions for simulating the component in different states and contexts.
    └── my-welcome.docs.mdx # Docs file for the component.
```

This structure has several benefits:

- Directory structure is easily consumable by placing all the related files together.
- File references become shorter and more readable.
- Easy to move components around in the workspace.
- Simple refactoring workflow, as changes are consolidated to the same place.
- `index` is a single point for consumers and maintainers to start from when doing any operation on the component.

## Adding a directory as a component

Tracking a directory as a Component can be done with the `bit add` command.

```bash
bit add path/to/component-dir --id ui/my-component
```

To learn more on tracking components in the Workspace. Head over to the [Tracking Components section](/workspace/tracking-components).

## Removing a component from the workspace

Removing a specific Component Directory in the Workspace can be achieved by using the `bit remove` command without the `--delete-files` flag which also removes the entire directory.

```bash
bit remove ui/my-welcome
```
