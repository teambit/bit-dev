# Component Directory

A Component Directory is a directory in the developer [Workspace](/workspace/overview). Directories are mapped as Components using the [.bitmap](/workspace/bitmap) `rootDir` property which exist for every [Component entry](/workspace/bitmap#component-entry).

Every component directory must at least include a [Main File](/components/main-file) and can be located anywhere throughout the Workspace outside of the [node_modules](/workspace/node-modules) directory and other Component Directories.

A common example component for a directory can be as following.

```bash
└── ui/my-welcome # Component directory
    ├── index.tsx # Main file.
    ├── my-welcome.tsx # Test file.
    ├── my-welcome.composition.tsx # Compositions for simulating the component in different states.
    └── my-welcome.docs.mdx # Docs file for the component.
```

## Adding a directory as a Component
Tracking a directory as a Component can be done with the `bit add` command.

```bash
bit add path/to/component-dir --id ui/my-component
```

<!--TODO To learn more on tracking components in the Workspace. Head over to the [Tracking Components section](/workspace/tracking-components). -->

## Removing a component directory
Removing a specific Component Directory in the Workspace can be achieved by using the `bit remove` command without the `--delete-files` flag which also removes the entire directory.

```bash
bit remove ui/my-welcome
```
