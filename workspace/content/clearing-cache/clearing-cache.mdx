# Clearing Cache

The `bit clear-cache` command removes the following:

1. Bit's compiled code (compiled as part of V8's Just-in-Time compilation). Caching is optimized using the [v8-compile-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/v8-compile-cache) package.

2. Components cache on the filesystem:

- The parsed component docs (e.g, prop types)
- The results for the dependency detection and resolution (saved in `.git/bit/components/deps/`).

3. The scope's index file `.git/bit/index.json`, which maps the component-id:object-hash.

```bash
$ bit clear-cache
the following cache(s) have been cleared:
  ✔ v8-compile-cache code
  ✔ components cache on the filesystem
  ✔ scope-index file
```
