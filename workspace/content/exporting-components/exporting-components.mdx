# Export Components

When you export components to Remote Scopes you make them available for other developers to consume and to collaborate on.
You can create Remote Scopes on your own server or use [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) instead, to manage your scopes in the cloud.


## Configure a component with a remote scope

The target scope for a component is determined by the scope section of its Component ID.
For example, `my-org.design-system/ui/button` is composed of the scope name, `my-org.design-system` and the component name `ui/button`.

When you create a new Component, you set the target Scope for it by providing a full Component ID. For example:

```
bit create react my-org.design-system/ui/button
```

Or, alternatively:

```
bit create react ui/button --scope my-org.design-system
```

A Component created without a scope will receive its scope from the Workspace configuration or Component configuration.

For example:

```json
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
    "defaultScope": "my-org.design-system"
  },
```

## Validate a component is ready to be exported

For a Component to be exportable, it must first be versioned (using `bit tag` or `bit snap`).
To validate a component is staged and ready to be exported, run the following:

```bash
bit status
```

For example, the following output lists 2 Components as new (not versioned/staged) and 2 that are staged and ready to be exported:

```bash
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > pages/welcome ... ok
     > ui/card ... ok

                         
staged components
(use "bit export <remote_scope> to push these components to a remote scope")

     > ui/text. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
     > ui/heading. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
```

Run the following to export all 'staged' (versioned) Components in your Workspace:

```sh
bit export
```

The output is similar to the following:

```bash
2 components were exported to scope teambit/base-ui
```

## Post Export

The export process updates your workspace' `.bitmap` file. Make sure to commit these changes to Git.

```bash
git commit -am 'updated .bitmap file after a successful export'
```

## Export During CI

To learn how to use your CI to export components, see [Automate exports](/docs/getting-started/set-up-ci/automate-export).

## Merge Conflicts

You may encounter a merge conflict when trying to export a Component version that already exists in the Component's remote scope (that happens when someone else exported a Component from another Workspace )

For example, the following tags a Component and bumps its version patch number : `1.0.4 --> 1.0.5` (Bit bumps the patch number on every tag, by default):
```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message"
```

When trying to export that version, an error is thrown. Version `1.0.5` of `teambit.base-ui/input/button` already exists in the `teambit.base-ui` Remote Scope:

```bash
$ bit export 

error: merge conflict occurred while importing the component teambit.base-ui/input/button. conflict version(s): 1.0.5
to resolve it and merge your local and remote changes, please do the following:
1) bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
2) bit import
3) bit checkout 1.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

To resolve that conflict, `untag` the Component’s local version.

```bash
bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
```

Import the latest version from the Remote Scope (in this case, `1.0.5`):

```bas
bit import
```

Checkout version `1.0.5` to merge the  latest changes with your own local changes: 

```bash
bit checkout 1.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

Tag and export again, after solving the conflict:

```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message" 
bit export
```

## Ejecting Components

Components exported to Bit are consumable with package managers. Bit allows ejecting components and replaces them with its node module. The name of this process is 'ejecting'. This is sugar syntax for both deleting the local component and running `bit install`.

Use the `eject` flag to replace an exported component with a node module:

```bash
bit export --eject
```

You can directly eject any component with the `eject` command:

```bash
bit eject ui/text
```
