# Exporting Components

Exporting components to remote scopes makes them available for other developers to consume and collaborate. You can create remote scopes on your own server or manage components' scopes in the [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) component hub.

The target scope of a component is determined by the applied scope definition for a component, as part of the component ID.

Once you have created staged [snaps](/components/snaps) or [versions](/components/tags), you can run the `status` command to validate that can safely export new versions.

```bash
bit status
```

In the below example, we see that our workspace has 4 components, and 2 of them have **staged versions**.

```bash
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > pages/welcome ... ok
     > ui/card ... ok

                         
staged components
(use "bit export <remote_scope> to push these components to a remote scope")

     > ui/text. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
     > ui/heading. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
```

Bit tells you exactly which versions are pending to be exported. Export them to a remote scope with the `export` command:

```bash
bit export
```

Bit then lets you know how many components were exported.

```bash
2 components were exported to scope teambit/base-ui
```

## Ejecting components

Components exported to Bit are consumable with package managers. Bit allows ejecting components and replaces them with its node module. The name of this process is 'ejecting'. This is sugar syntax for both deleting the local component and running `bit install`.

Use the `eject` flag to replace an exported component with a node module:

```bash
bit export --eject
```

You can directly eject any component with the `eject` command:

```bash
bit eject ui/text
```

## Post export

The export process updates your workspace' `.bitmap` file. Make sure to commit these changes to Git.

```bash
git commit -am 'updated .bitmap file after a successful export'
```

## Export during CI

[See here](/getting-started/set-up-ci/automate-export) to learn how to use your CI to export components.

## Merge conflicts

You may encounter a merge conflict, for example, if you tagged a new version and exported it, but there's already a version with the same SemVer. Let's look at how we would resolve this.  

The flow starts with running `export`, trying to export a new version:

```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message"
bit export
```

We tried to export `1.0.5` for `teambit.base-ui/input/button`, but there's already `1.0.5` on the remote.

```bash
error: merge conflict occurred while importing the component teambit.base-ui/input/button. conflict version(s): 1.0.5
to resolve it and merge your local and remote changes, please do the following:
1) bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
2) bit import
3) bit checkout 1.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

To resolve the conflict, `untag` the component's local version.

```bash
bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
```

Now we use `import` to update the local component history, so we have `1.0.5` from the remote.

```bash
bit import
```

Checkout version `1.0.5` so you can merge your changes on top of it.

```bash
bit checkout 1.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

Tag and export again, after solving the conflict.

```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message" 
bit export
```
