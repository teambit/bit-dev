# Exporting Components

Exporting is the process of copying Component versions from the Local Scope to remote Scopes, to make them available to other projects.

Components can be exported to Scopes on Bit Cloud or to self-hosted Scopes. Bit exports each component to the specific Scope configured for it by the Workspace/Component Configurations.

## Export all Staged Components

To export all component versions that have not yet been exported:

```bash
bit export
```

## Export Selected Components

To export only selected components, list the component IDs:

```bash
bit export <component-id>
```

## Configuring Components with Scopes

See here to learn how to configure Components with Scopes.

## Creating a Scope

- Create a Scope on Bit Cloud
- Self-host a Scope

## Post Export

The export process updates your workspace' `.bitmap` file. Make sure to commit these changes to Git.

```bash
git commit -am 'updated .bitmap file after a successful export'
```

## Export by a Remote Caching

[See here](/docs/getting-started/set-up-ci/automate-export) to learn how to use your CI to export components.
