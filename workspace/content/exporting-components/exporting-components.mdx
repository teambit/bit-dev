# Exporting Components

Exporting components to remote scopes makes them available for other developers to consume and collaborate. You can create remote scopes on your own server or manage components' scopes the [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) components hub.

The target scope of a component is determined by the applied scope definition for a component, as part of the component ID.

After you created staged [snaps](/docs/components/snaps) or [versions](/docs/components/tags). To validate you can safely export new versions, run the `status` command.

```bash
bit status
```

Here we see that our workspace has 4 components, and 2 of them have **staged versions**.

```bash
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > pages/welcome ... ok
     > ui/card ... ok

                         
staged components
(use "bit export <remote_scope> to push these components to a remote scope")

     > ui/text. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
     > ui/heading. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
```

Bit tells you exactly which versions are pending to be exported. Export them to a remote scope with the `export` command:

```sh
bit export
```

Bit then lets you know how many components were exported.

```bash
2 components were exported to scope teambit/base-ui
```

## Ejecting Components

Components exported to Bit are consumable with package managers. Bit allows ejecting components and replaces them with its node module. The name of this process is 'ejecting'. This is sugar syntax for both deleting the local component and running `bit install`.

Use the `eject` flag to replace an exported component with a node module:

```bash
bit export --eject
```

You can directly eject any component with the `eject` command:

```bash
bit eject ui/text
```

## Post Export

The export process updates your workspace' `.bitmap` file. Make sure to commit these changes to Git.

```bash
git commit -am 'updated .bitmap file after a successful export'
```

## Export During CI

[See here](/docs/getting-started/set-up-ci/automate-export) to learn how to use your CI to export components.
