# Importing Components
The import process fetches Components from their Remote Scopes, and makes them usable and maintainable in your local Workspace.

To import a Component to your Workspace, run the following inside that Workspace:
```
bit import COMPONENT_ID
```
for example:

```bash
bit import teambit.base-ui/input/button
```
The output should be similar to the following:

```bash
✔ installing dependencies using pnpm
✔ running post install subscribers
✔ linking components
successfully imported one component
- added teambit.base-ui/input/button new versions: 0.5.9, 0.5.10, 0.6.0, 0.6.2, 0.6.3, 0.6.4, 0.6.5, 0.6.6, 0.6.7, 0.6.8, 0.6.9, 0.6.10, 0.6.11, 0.6.12, 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, currently used version 1.0.3 
```

Once a Component is imported successfully, its dependencies are installed and its source files are placed in the Workspace's default directory path for Components.

For example, the following directory structure was generated for `teambit.base-ui/input/button`:

```bash
base-ui                            # Imported component "scope"
└── input                          # Imported component "namespace
    └── button                     # Imported component "name"
        ├── button.composition.tsx
        ├── button.docs.mdx
        ├── button.module.scss
        ├── button.spec.tsx
        ├── button.tsx
        └── index.ts
```

:::tip override `defaultDirectory` with the `--path` option.

```bash
bit import COMPONENT_ID --path DIRECTORY_PATH
```

## Use and maintain an imported component

Once a Component is imported to a Workspace, it behaves much like Components authored in that Workspace.
It can be modified, built, versioned, and exported. 

:::info Component modifications
Changes to a Component are not limited to its source files. They can also include its dependencies and configurations. 
:::

An imported Component is also consumable by other Components in that Workspace.
Bit creates a package for the Component, in the Workspace's `node_modules` directory. This package contains the Component's dist files as well as links to its source files (in the Workspace).
Other Components in your Workspace can use the imported Component by referencing its (absolute) package name. For example:

```javascript
import { Button } from '@teambit/base-ui.input.button';
```

## Fetch Component updates

To fetch the latest updates for Components in your Workspace, run:

```bash
bit import
```

The output, in case a newer version is available, is similar to the following:

```bash
successfully imported 1 component
- updated teambit.base-ui/input/button new versions: 1.0.1
```
### Checkout a Component version

Fetching new versions makes them available in your Workspace, or more specifically in your Local Scope. However, it does not replace the current version in your working directory.
To get a status of which versions are used and which are available to use, run `bit status`. For example:

```bash
$ bit status

pending updates
(use "bit checkout [version] [component_id]" to merge changes)
(use "bit log [component_id]" to list all available versions)

    > teambit.base-ui/input/button current: 1.0.0 latest: 1.0.1
```

The above output informs of a newer available version for `teambit.base-ui/input/button`.
To checkout the latest version, and replace the current files and configuration with the newer ones, run the following:

```
bit checkout COMPONENT_VERSION COMPONENT_ID
```

For example:

```bash
bit checkout 1.0.1 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

The output (for a successful checkout) lists the files affected by the checkout:

```bash
successfully switched teambit.base-ui/input/button to version 1.0.1

updated base-ui/input/button.spec.ts
updated base-ui/input/index.ts
auto-merged base-ui/input/button.ts
```

The component is now on the version that was checked out with the local changes on top of it.

:::info Merge with local changes
Bit uses git to resolve conflicts between local changes in your Component and the 
When you have local changes on a component, and you checkout to new version, Bit uses Git to resolve any conflicts. Anything that is not automatically resolved requires a manual intervention. Learn more in [Merge conflicts](/docs/components/merge-conflicts).
