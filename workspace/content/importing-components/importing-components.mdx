# Importing Components

You can import a component from a remote scope to a Bit workspace. Imported components are just like any other component: They can be modified, compiled, tested and used as dependencies for other components. You may also snap and version imported components.

<Image src={importVisual} width="60%" />

Use the `import` command in a Bit workspace.

```bash
bit import teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

```bash
✔ installing dependencies using pnpm
✔ running post install subscribers
✔ linking components
successfully imported one component
- added teambit.base-ui/input/button new versions: 0.5.9, 0.5.10, 0.6.0, 0.6.2, 0.6.3, 0.6.4, 0.6.5, 0.6.6, 0.6.7, 0.6.8, 0.6.9, 0.6.10, 0.6.11, 0.6.12, 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, currently used version 1.0.3 
```

:::tip Copy your component's `import` command from the component page's "use" section

<Image src={importDropDown} width="50%" />

:::

The import process fetches the component, install its dependencies, creates a directory for the component in the workspace for placing its implementation. Component location is set according to the `defaultDirectory` setting in your `workspace.jsonc` file

```bash
base-ui                            # Imported component "scope"
└── input                          # Imported component "namespace
    └── button                     # Imported component "name"
        ├── button.composition.tsx
        ├── button.docs.mdx
        ├── button.module.scss
        ├── button.spec.tsx
        ├── button.tsx
        └── index.ts
```

:::tip override `defaultDirectory` with the `--path` option.

```bash
bit import teambit.base-ui/input/button --path random/directory
```

## Just like using any component

Imported components appear when you run `bit start`, compiled during `bit compile` and tested during `bit test`. Change and use them as you would work with any other component you created.

You may import them as dependencies for other components.

```javascript
import { Button } from '@teambit/base-ui.input.button'; // Bit creates a node_module link for your imported component
```

Past versions are available for `checkout`, so you can [navigate version history](/docs/components/navigating-history)

```bash
bit checkout 0.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button  # checkout version 0.0.5
bit checkout latest teambit.base-ui/input/button # checkout latest version
```

When you no longer need a component in a workspace you can eject it and replace with a dependency.

```bash
bit eject teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

Additionally, you can also modify the component, create [versions](/docs/components/tags) or [snaps](/docs/components/snaps) and [export](/docs/components/exporting-components) them:

```bash
bit snap teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "snapshot a component from any workspace"
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "versioning a component from any workspace"
bit export
```

## Fetching updates

If a new version is available for a component, you can import it. This flow happens automatically when you run `install` or `import` with now arguments.

```bash
bit import
```

When new version is available, Bit prints a message on new version available.

```bash
successfully imported 1 component
- updated teambit.base-ui/input/button new versions: 1.0.1
```

Running `status` also shows pending new versions, once imported.

```bash
bit status
```

`status` tells you which version you currently have in the workspace, and what is the latest available version to checkout.

```bash
pending updates
(use "bit checkout [version] [component_id]" to merge changes)
(use "bit log [component_id]" to list all available versions)

    > teambit.base-ui/input/button current: 1.0.0 latest: 1.0.1
```

Use the `checkout` command to update your workspace to the latest version.

```bash
bit checkout latest teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

If they are any dependency changes, your `node_modules` will be updated. All source files of the component will be updates as well.

```bash
successfully switched teambit.base-ui/input/button to version 1.0.1

updated base-ui/input/button.spec.ts
updated base-ui/input/index.ts
auto-merged base-ui/input/button.ts
```

The component is now on the version that was checked out with the local changes on top of it.

:::info Merge with local changes

When you have local changes on a component, and you checkout to new version, Bit uses Git to resolve any conflicts. Anything that is not automatically resolved requires a manual intervention. Learn more [here](/docs/components/merge-conflicts).
