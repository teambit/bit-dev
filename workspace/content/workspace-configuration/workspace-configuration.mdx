# Configuring the Workspace (workspace.jsonc)

The `workspace.jsonc` serves as the main configuration file for the workspace and its components.

`workspace.jsonc` is composed of a list of Aspects, and their corresponding configurations.
For example, the following configuration is used to configure two Aspects:

- `teambit.workspace/workspace`: The Workspace Aspect (responsible for the Workspace)
- `teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver`: The Dependency Resolver Aspect (responsible for dependency management)

Since each Aspect is a [Component](/docs/components/components-overview), it uses the [Component ID](/docs/components/component-id) pattern.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
    "defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}",
    "defaultScope": "company.scope"
  },
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/pnpm",
    "policy": {
      "dependencies": {
        "classnames": "2.3.1",
        "text-transform": "^0.1.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The workspace configuration is extensible. It is not limited to a pre-configured list of Aspects. Any Aspect that implements the config

## teambit.workspace/workspace

`teambit.workspace/workspace` receives configurations for the workspace itself, as well as default values for components managed by the workspace.

### name

```ts
name: string;
```

The name of the workspace. This name will be displayed in the workspace UI.

### icon

```ts
icon: string;
```

Th path to an icon (svg, jpeg, etc.). The icon wll be displayed in the workspace UI.

### defaultScope

```ts
defaultScope: string;
```

The default scope for all components in the workspace (this will be overridden by any other source of configuration, For example, variant)

### defaultDirectory

```ts
defaultDirectory: string;
```

The default directory (relative path) to place a component during `bit import` and `bit create`.

The following placeholders are available:

<!-- TODO: add links to component id page -->

- `name` - the component full name
- `scopeId` - the scope-id
- `scope` - scope name
- `owner` - owner name

For example:

```json
{
  "defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}"
}
```

## Adding an Aspect to the workspace configuration

Adding an Aspect to the workspace configuration will apply that Aspect, by default, on all components in the workspace.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    // ..
  },
  "my-org.my-aspects/aspect-x": {}
}
```
