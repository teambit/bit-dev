# Configuring the Workspace (workspace.jsonc)

The `workspace.jsonc` serves as the main configuration file for the workspace and its components.

`workspace.jsonc` is composed of a list of Aspects, and their corresponding configurations.
For example, the following configuration is used to configure two Aspects:

- `teambit.workspace/workspace`: The Workspace Aspect (responsible for the Workspace)
- `teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver`: The Dependency Resolver Aspect (responsible for dependency management)

Since each Aspect is a [Component](/docs/components/components-overview), it uses the [Component ID](/docs/components/component-id) pattern.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
    "defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}",
    "defaultScope": "company.scope"
  },
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/pnpm",
    "policy": {
      "dependencies": {
        "classnames": "2.3.1",
        "text-transform": "^0.1.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The workspace configuration is extensible. It is not limited to a pre-configured list of Aspects. Any Aspect that implements the config

## teambit.workspace/workspace

`teambit.workspace/workspace` receives configurations for the workspace itself, as well as default values for components managed by the workspace.

### name

```ts
name: string;
```

The name of the workspace. This name will be displayed in the workspace UI.

### icon

```ts
icon: string;
```

Th path to an icon (svg, jpeg, etc.). The icon wll be displayed in the workspace UI.

### defaultScope

```ts
defaultScope: string;
```

The default scope for all components in the workspace (this will be overridden by any other source of configuration, For example, variant)

### defaultDirectory

```ts
defaultDirectory: string;
```

The default directory (relative path) to place a component during `bit import` and `bit create`.

The following placeholders are available:

<!-- TODO: add links to component id page -->

- `name` - the component full name
- `scopeId` - the scope-id
- `scope` - scope name
- `owner` - owner name

For example:

```json
{
  "defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}"
}
```

## Adding an Aspect to the workspace configuration

Adding an Aspect to the workspace configuration will apply that Aspect, by default, on all components in the workspace.

For example, the custom Aspect `company.scope/extensions/my-dev-files` defines files that match the glob pattern '\*_/_.my-dev._' as [dev files](/docs/components/dev-files).
Adding that Aspect to the workspace configuration will apply it on all components in the workspace (which will set every component's `_.my-dev.\*` file as a dev file).

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    // ..
  },
  "company.scope/extensions/my-dev-files": {}
}
```
