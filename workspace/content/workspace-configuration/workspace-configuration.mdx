# Workspace configuration (workspace.jsonc)

The `workspace.jsonc` serves as the main configuration file for the workspace and its components.

`workspace.jsonc` is composed of Aspect IDs ([Component IDs](/components/component-id)) and their corresponding configurations.
To add configuration to the `workspace.jsonc`, first add the relevant Aspect ID, and then set its configuration.

For example, to set the Workspace name, add `teambit.workspace/workspace` (which handles the Workspace) and set its `"name"` property.
To set versions to install in that Workspace, add `teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver` (which handles dependencies), and set its `"policy"` property.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
  },
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "policy": {
      "dependencies": {
        "classnames": "2.3.1",
        "text-transform": "^0.1.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::note Extensible configurations
The workspace configuration is not limited to a pre-defined set of Aspects. Any Aspect, either from Bit or from the community, can be added as well.
Check your Aspect's docs to learn how to configure it in the Workspace.
:::

## Configure the Workspace aspect

`teambit.workspace/workspace` receives configurations for the workspace itself, as well as default values for components managed by that workspace.

## name

```ts
name: string;
```

The name of the workspace. This name will be displayed in the workspace UI.

## icon

```ts
icon: string;
```

Th path to an icon (svg, jpeg, etc.). The icon wll be displayed in the workspace UI.

## defaultScope

```ts
defaultScope: string;
```

The default scope for all components in the workspace (this will be overridden by any other source of configuration, For example, variant)

## defaultDirectory

```ts
defaultDirectory: string;
```

The default directory (relative path) to place a component during `bit import` and `bit create`.

The following placeholders are available:

<!-- TODO: add links to component id page -->

- `name` - the component full name
- `scopeId` - the scope-id
- `scope` - scope name
- `owner` - owner name

For example:

```json
{
  "defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}"
}
```

## Add a new Aspect configuration

When you add an Aspect to the workspace configuration you affect all components in _that_ Workspace.

For example, the custom Aspect `my-org.my-scope/snapshot` defines files that match the glob pattern `**/snapshot.*` as [dev files](/docs/components/dev-files).
Adding that Aspect to the workspace configuration will define the `**/snapshot.*` files of every component in that Workspace as a dev files.

```json
{
  "my-org.my-scope/snapshots": {
    "useDevFiles": true
  }
}
```

:::note 
Workspace configuration only affect components in that Workspace.
Once a component is exported and maintained in another Workspace, it will no longer be affected by that Aspect.
For information about how to apply an Aspect on a Component, see [Component configuration](/components/component-config).
