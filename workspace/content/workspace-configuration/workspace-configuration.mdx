# Workspace configuration (workspace.jsonc)

The `workspace.jsonc` serves as the main configuration file for the workspace and its components.

`workspace.jsonc` is composed of Aspect IDs ([Component IDs](/components/component-id)) and their corresponding configurations.
To add configuration to the `workspace.jsonc`, first add the relevant Aspect ID, and then set its configuration.

For example, to set the Workspace name, add `teambit.workspace/workspace` (which handles the Workspace) and set its `"name"` property.
To set versions to install in that Workspace, add `teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver` (which handles dependencies), and set its `"policy"` property.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
  },
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "policy": {
      "dependencies": {
        "classnames": "2.3.1",
        "text-transform": "^0.1.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::info Extensible configurations
The workspace configuration is not limited to a pre-defined set of Aspects. Any Aspect, either from Bit or from the community, can be added as well.
See the documentation for the specific Aspect you'd like to configure. 
:::

## Configure the Workspace aspect

`teambit.workspace/workspace` receives configurations for the workspace itself, as well as default values for components managed by that workspace.

## name

```ts
name: string;
```

The name of the workspace. This name will be displayed in the workspace UI.

## icon

```ts
icon: string;
```

Th path to an icon (svg, jpeg, etc.). The icon wll be displayed in the workspace UI.

## defaultScope

```ts
defaultScope: string;
```

The default scope for all components in the workspace (this will be overridden by any other source of configuration, For example, variant)

## defaultDirectory

```ts
defaultDirectory: string;
```

The default directory (relative path) to place a component during `bit import` and `bit create`.

The following placeholders are available:

<!-- TODO: add links to component id page -->

- `name` - the component full name
- `scopeId` - the scope-id
- `scope` - scope name
- `owner` - owner name

For example:

```json
{
  "defaultDirectory": "{scope}/{name}"
}
```

## Add a new Aspect configuration

When you add an Aspect to the workspace configuration you affect all components in _that_ Workspace.

For example, the custom Aspect `my-org.my-scope/snapshot` defines files that match the glob pattern `**/snapshot.*` as [dev files](/docs/components/dev-files).
Adding that Aspect to the workspace configuration will define the `**/snapshot.*` files of every component in that Workspace as a dev files.

```json
{
  "my-org.my-scope/snapshots": {
    "useDevFiles": true
  }
}
```

:::note 
Workspace configuration only affect components in that Workspace.
Once a component is exported and maintained in another Workspace, it will no longer be affected by that Aspect.
For information about how to apply an Aspect on a Component, see [Component configuration](/components/component-config).
