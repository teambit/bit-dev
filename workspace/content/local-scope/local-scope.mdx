# Local Scope

The Local Scope is located in the `.bit` or `.git/bit` directory at the root of the Workspace. It is where component versions (snapshots) are stored.
The stored versions are either authored in the workspace or imported into it.

The local scope serves three main functions:

- It is where "staged" components are stored before they are exported to a remote scope.
- It is where component data that is not written to the workspace (but used by Bit), is stored. That includes imported components, as well as components authored in the Workspace.
- It enables the workspace to recognize whether a component has been modified by comparing the immutable version stored in the local scope to the component files tracked by the workspace.

## scope.json

TBD

## index.json

The `index.json` file maps components (scope name and full component name) to their objects (hash) in the local scope.

## The Local Scope and git

While workspaces should be tracked by git, to enable collaboration on workspace config and pre-versioned components, the Local Scope should be excluded.

Components are versioned independently, completely decoupled from any git repository.

Tracking the component objects (in the Local Scope) with git will result in conflicts as new component versions (and therefor, new/modified objects) can originate from any other workspace/repository.
