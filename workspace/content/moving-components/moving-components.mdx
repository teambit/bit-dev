# Moving and renaming components

## Move a component to a different directory

To move a component to another directory in the Workspace, run the following:

```
bit move CURRENT_COMPONENT_PATH NEW_COMPONENT_PATH
```

For example, the following command moves the `company.demo/ui/text` Component from `demo/ui/text` to `demo/elements/text`:

```
bit move demo/ui/text demo/elements/text
```

:::note Moving a component does not change its namespaces.

## Rename a new component

A new Component is a Component that has never been versioned. 
To rename a new Component, first, untrack it:

```bash
bit untrack CURRENT_COMPONENT_ID
```

Then, track back the component using its new name:

```
bit add PATH_TO_COMPONENT --id COMPONENT_NAME
```

### Rename a Component that has dependents

An Component might have dependent Components. Changing its Component ID or removing the Component will break it them.

To avoid that, set the Component as `deprecated` and create a new one (with the new name).

```bash
bit deprecate teambit.design/ui/buttons/button
```

```bash
bit add ui/buttons/button
```

Once the previous component is not longer used by other Components (as they have been all updated to use the new one), it can be removed:

```
bit remove teambit.design/ui/buttons/button
```
