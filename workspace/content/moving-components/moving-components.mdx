# Moving Components

To move a component you can use the `bit move` command. This command will move the component from the current directory to the new directory.

## Move a component to a different directory

```bash
bit move ui/my-component design/my-component
```

:::tip
This will only affect how your components are ordered in your workspace and not in your `.bitmap` file. If you want to move a component to a different namespace you will need to first remove it and then add it again with the correct namespace.

## Moving components between repositories

Components can be migrated between different repositories with ease.

In the origin repository, eject the component to be used as an external dependency.

```bash
$ bit eject teambit.design/ui/buttons/button
```

Then, import the component into the target repository.

```bash
$ bit import teambit.design/ui/buttons/button
```
