# Moving Components

To move a component you can use the `bit move` command. This command will move the component from the current directory to the new directory.

## Move a component to a different directory

```bash
bit move ui/my-component design/my-component
```

:::tip
This will only affect how your components are ordered in your workspace and not in your `.bitmap` file. If you want to move a component to a different namespace you will need to first remove it and then add it again with the correct namespace.

## Renaming a component

Renaming a component

### Renaming a new component

Renaming a new component can be done by untracking the original component and tracking it again with a new ID.

Untracking a button component can be done with `bit untrack`.

```bash
bit untrack teambit.design/ui/buttons/button
```

Then, track back the component

```
bit add design/ui/buttons/button --id ui/button
```

### Renaming a used component

```bash
bit deprecate teambit.design/ui/buttons/button
```

```bash
bit remove teambit.design/ui/buttons/button
```

```bash
bit add ui/buttons/button
```

## Moving compoenents between repositories

Components can be migrated between different repositories with ease.

In the origin repository, eject the component to be used as an external dependency.

```bash
$ bit eject teambit.design/ui/buttons/button
```

Then, import the component into the target repository.

```bash
$ bit import teambit.design/ui/buttons/button
```
