# Use Apps

[Apps](https://bit.dev/docs/apps/apps-overview) are deployable components that are consumable in runtime. That includes full applications, as well as, microservices, micro-frontends and serverless functions.
Just like other components, apps are independent. They contain all the information they need to be built, served and deployed.

Apps can be of different types. An app's type is determined by the [application-type](https://bit.dev/docs/apps/application-types) responsible for building, serving and deploying it.

Follow the instructions below to try an app for yourself.
