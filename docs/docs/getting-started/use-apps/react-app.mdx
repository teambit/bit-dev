:::info Deploying an app
React apps do not provide their own default deployer. To learn how to set a deployer see [App deployment](https://bit.dev/docs/apps/app-deployment).
To explore a demo React app configured with a deployer, see this [React app with Netlify deployer](https://bit.cloud/learnbit/apps/netlify/react-app) or this [React app with Cloudflare deployer](https://bit.cloud/learnbit/apps/cloudflare/react-app).
