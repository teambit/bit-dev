# Create components

A component is a reusable, independently source-controlled module, that is stored in [scopes](https://bit.dev/docs/scope/scope-overview) and maintained in [workspaces](https://bit.dev/docs/workspace/workspace-overview).
Components enable a new software development strategy that can be used to complement monorepos and poly-repos, or replace them, altogether.

To create a component use one of the [available component templates](https://bit.dev/docs/dev-services/generator/generator-overview#component-templates):

<BitCreate />

For example, the following creates a component named `apps/to-do` using Bit's React template. It sets `my-org.tasks-scope` as its scope name.

<BitCreateWithExample />

The output is similar to the following:

<BitCreateOutput />

<TodoCardAndAbout />

<br />

_Note: the component used for this demo is not identical to the one created in your workspace. The implementation for this component can be copied from the editor down below._

## Component files

A component can be of different types. A NodeJS module, an Angular component, a CSS module, and so on.
Since this component was created by the react template, the generated files are for a React component.
These files include standard React implementation files, as well as development files that are handled by the different tools ('env services') the React env provides.

<ExploreComponentFiles />

Head over to the workspace UI ([http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)), to further explore the component (run `bit start` to run the UI server).

## Component configuration and metadata

For a component to be independently consumable and maintainable, it must contain information regarding its dependencies, development tools, configurations, and more.
This information is constantly being re-calculated during development, and once the component is versioned, it is persisted in the component snapshots.

Our new component is already configured with the React env, as well as a set of core 'Bit aspects', which are a certain type of components that compose Bit.
The metadata of this component is the sum of data generated by these aspects (including the env).

To inspect a component's metadata and configuration run the following:

<BitShow />

For example, to inspect our new component, run:

<BitShowWithExample />

The output is similar to the following. **Click on the different sections** to learn more about each of them.
