#### Component name

A component's name should describe the component goal. In this case the component (`ui/button`) functions as a visual button.

Components are often prefixed with one or more namespaces, to provide the component name with additional context (in this case, `ui`).
Namespaces also help organize components in workspaces and scopes, in a hierarchal fashion.

Use the component name to perform actions on components in your workspace (not in remote scopes as they require the full id).
