# Bit Version Manager

[BVM](https://github.com/teambit/bvm) is a version manager for Bit.  
Using BVM makes it easier to install and manage multiple versions of Bit in a single environment.

## Features

- **Consistent installation:** All Bit dependencies are bundled together to ensure a consistent and predictable package installation that is not affected by SemVer rules.
- **Fast installation:** A simple and quick installation process that requires no additional time-consuming operations (post-install scripts, etc.)
- **Friendly UX:** Easy upgrades and version management
- **Multiple Bit versions:** Easily switch between Bit versions or even use multiple versions in parallel

## Install BVM

```bash
npm i -g @teambit/bvm
yarn global add @teambit/bvm
```

## Install Bit

```bash title="Install Bit's latest version"
bvm install
```

```bash title="Upgrade Bit's version"
bvm upgrade
```

## Troubleshooting

### Getting errors due to firewall/proxy

Depending on your proxy or firewall settings, use the following configs to have BVM use the correct proxy:

```bash
bvm config set proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080
bvm config set https_proxy https://proxy.example.com:8080;
```

### BVM is not recognized in your terminal

If you get this error, run:

#### Windows

```bash
setx path "%path%;%AppData%\npm" and re-open your terminal
```

:::note
Important! Make sure to copy and store your path variable before running the above command, so that you can restore your path if needed (e.g. if it exceeds the maximum path length). 
If it does exceed the maximum, you will likely be able to reduce its current length by using common path aliases such as `%AppData% used above, which replaces the full path 
to your user's AppData folder.

#### MacOS/Linux

```bash with Zsh
# npm
echo 'export PATH=$(npm bin -g):$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
# yarn
echo 'export PATH=$(yarn global bin):$PATH'  >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

```bash with Bash
# npm
echo 'export PATH=$(npm bin -g):$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
# yarn
echo 'export PATH=$(yarn global bin):$PATH'  >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

### Global Bit install location was not found

#### Windows

Please run the following command:

```bash
setx path "%path%;%LocalAppData%\.bvm"
```

then re-open the terminal.

#### MacOS/Linux

Please run the following command:

```bash with Zsh
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

```bash with Bash
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

then re-open the terminal.

## Using v15 and v14

If you have a previous version of Bit installed (`bit-bin`), the default binary name for v15 will be `bbit`.

You can change the binary name for Harmony by running the following command after installing BVM and before installing Bit.

```sh
bvm config set DEFAULT_LINK <new-value>
```

## Manage versions

```bash title="Get version information"
bvm version
```

```bash title="List available versions"
bvm list --remote
```

```bash title="List installed versions"
bvm list
```

```bash title="Remove a local version"
bvm remove <bit-version>
```

## BVM configurations

BVM has several configurations

- `DEFAULT_LINK` - The default command name to be linked to BVM's latest version.  
  `bit` is linked by default unless a legacy version of Bit is installed. In that case, `bbit` will be linked, instead.
- `BVM_DIR` - The location for BVM

```bash title="Get BVM configurations"
bvm config
```

```bash title="Set BVM configurations"
bvm config set <property> <new-value>
```
