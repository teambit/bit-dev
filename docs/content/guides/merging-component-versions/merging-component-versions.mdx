# Merge Conflicts

You may encounter a merge conflict, if you tagged a new version and exported it, but there's such version already shared. Let's resolve such conflict.  

The flow starts with running `export`, trying to export a new version:

```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message"
bit export
```

We tried to export `1.0.5` for `teambit.base-ui/input/button`, but there's already `1.0.5` on the remote..

```bash
error: merge conflict occurred while importing the component teambit.base-ui/input/button. conflict version(s): 1.0.5
to resolve it and merge your local and remote changes, please do the following:
1) bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
2) bit import
3) bit checkout 1.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

To resolve the conflict, `untag` the componentâ€™s local version.

```bash
bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
```

Now we use `import` to update the local component history, so we have `1.0.5` from the remote.

```bas
bit import
```

Checkout version `1.0.5` so you can merge your changes on top of it.

```bash
bit checkout 1.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

Tag and export again, after solving the conflict.

```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message" 
bit export
```
