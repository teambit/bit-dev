# Merge Conflicts

Components are version-controlled, collaborating on them is all about managing contributions from multiple authors. Sometimes your changes will conflict with others editing the same component.  
Bridge this gap by merging the other's changes into your own.

## Conflicts on exported versions

Component versions are immutable, and once exported can't be changed. This means that once a component was versioned with a specific semantic version, others can't change it or export a different implementation of the component with the same semantic version.  
If you happen to encounter such a case, Bit will trigger a **merge conflict**. To continue the export process, you must resolve the conflict and set another semantic version.

:::tip avoid merge conflicts by running `bit import` to fetch new remote versions before you `tag` and `export`
:::

Tag a component with a semver and try to export it:

```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message"
bit export
```

```bash
error: merge conflict occurred while importing the component teambit.base-ui/input/button. conflict version(s): 1.0.5
to resolve it and merge your local and remote changes, please do the following:
1) bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
2) bit import
3) bit checkout 1.0.2 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

You tried to export `1.0.2` for `teambit.base-ui/input/button`, but Bit tells you that version is already available, and that there's even a future version called `1.0.5` on the remote.  
Follow the on-screen instructions to resolve the conflict. Start by using the `untag` command, to remove the conflicted version.

```bash
bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
```

Now we use `import` to get `1.0.5` from the remote.

```bas
bit import
```

Checkout the component to version `1.0.5` and merge your changes on top of it.

```bash
bit checkout 1.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

Now you can safely `tag` a new version and export, after solving the conflict.

```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message" 
bit export
```

## Merge with local changes

Modified components in a Bit workspace can get upstream changes. If there are any local changes, the `checkout` command merges them with the upcoming changes. In cases where upstream change conflicts with your local, a local **merge conflict** is triggered.

When you have a **modified component** and it has newer versions, `bit status` shows the following:

```bash
pending updates
(use "bit checkout [version] [component_id]" to merge changes)
(use "bit log [component_id]" to list all available versions)

    > teambit.base-ui/input/button current: 1.0.0 latest: 1.0.1

modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

    > teambit.base-ui/input/button ... ok
```

Here use the same `checkout` command. Bit will use Git in an attempt to automatically merge changes between local changes the incoming version.  
If there's a merge conflict, you get this output:

```bash
successfully switched teambit.base-ui/input/button to version 1.0.5
updated base-ui/input/button.spec.ts
updated base-ui/input/index.ts
CONFLICT base-ui/input/button.ts automatic merge failed. please fix conflicts manually and then tag the results.
```

You can use the several options when `checkout` to resolve conflicts.

- `--theirs` - the remote version overrides the local modifications.
- `--ours` - the local implementation overrides the remote changes.
- `--manual` - resolve the conflict manually.

Once merge is resolved, run `bit status` and see the result.

```status
modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > teambit.base-ui/input/button ... ok
```
