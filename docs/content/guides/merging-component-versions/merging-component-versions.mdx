# Merge Conflicts

You may encounter a merge conflict, if you tagged a new version and exported it, but there's such version already shared. Let's resolve such conflict.  

The flow starts with running `export`, trying to export a new version:

```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message"
bit export
```

We tried to export `1.0.5` for `teambit.base-ui/input/button`, but there's already `1.0.5` on the remote..

```bash
error: merge conflict occurred while importing the component teambit.base-ui/input/button. conflict version(s): 1.0.5
to resolve it and merge your local and remote changes, please do the following:
1) bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
2) bit import
3) bit checkout 1.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

To resolve the conflict, `untag` the componentâ€™s local version.

```bash
bit untag teambit.base-ui/input/button 1.0.5
```

Now we use `import` to update the local component history, so we have `1.0.5` from the remote.

```bas
bit import
```

Checkout version `1.0.5` so you can merge your changes on top of it.

```bash
bit checkout 1.0.5 teambit.base-ui/input/button
```

Tag and export again, after solving the conflict.

```bash
bit tag teambit.base-ui/input/button --message "my message" 
bit export
```

## Merge with local changes

Bit behaves slightly differently when importing changes for a component that was modified locally.  
When you run `bit status` and a modified component has an incoming change it is listed in both **modified** and has **pending updates**.

```bash
pending updates
(use "bit checkout [version] [component_id]" to merge changes)
(use "bit log [component_id]" to list all available versions)

    > teambit.base-ui/input/button current: 1.0.0 latest: 1.0.1

modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

    > teambit.base-ui/input/button ... ok
```

Here use the same `checkout` command. Bit will use Git in an attempt to automatically merge changes between local changes the incoming version.  
Merge conflicts may occur:

```bash
successfully switched teambit.base-ui/input/button to version 1.0.5
updated base-ui/input/button.spec.ts
updated base-ui/input/index.ts
CONFLICT base-ui/input/button.ts automatic merge failed. please fix conflicts manually and then tag the results.
```

You can use the several options when `checkout` to resolve conflicts.

- `--theirs` - the remote version overrides the local modifications.
- `--ours` - the local implementation overrides the remote changes.
- `--manual` - resolve the conflict manually.

Once merge is resolved, run `bit status` and see the result.

```status
modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > teambit.base-ui/input/button ... ok
```
