# Add to an existing project

You can use Bit to start liberating components in existing projects. To start liberating components head over to your project root directory:

```bash
cd my-project
```

Initialize Bit on your project.
```bash
bit init
```

This adds three files to your project, [`workspace.json`](/docs/workspace/workspace-config), [`.bitmap`](/docs/workspace/bitmap) and the hidden `.bit` (or `.git/bit` when
initialized on a git repository) directory which includes the Workspace's [local Scope](/scope/local-scope). Once Bit is initialized on your project, you can start 
liberating components.

Start Bit:
```
bit start
```

## Installing dependencies

We recommend using Bit to install dependnecies on your workspace. It makes sure every components gets the right dependencies and their corrosponding versions to resolve.

```bash
bit install
```

:::note
To keep using pnpm, npm or yarn directly, configure Bit to fetch updates on post-install, learn more on [using package
managers directly here](/dependencies/package-managers#using-package-managers-directly).

## Liberating components

Liberating components is the process for taking an existing component, coupled to a specific app and transforming it to be independent.  

- Decide which component you are liberating.
- See how the component is used.
- Create the component. -> Create a component -> Go to quick start.

Wrapping dependencies

components/design/

function Button() {
  return <Button>
}

## Common use cases
Bit can be used side to side with tools like NextJS, CRA or anything else.
