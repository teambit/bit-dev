# Add to an existing project

You can initialize Bit on any existing workspace to start sharing components. Bit has a minimal footprint on your project and can run alongside existing tools.  
Start sharing components by heading over to your project root:

```bash
cd my-project
```

Initialize Bit in your project.

```bash
bit init
```

`init` will not use any of the templates for [creating a workspace](/getting-started/installing-bit/start-bit-workspace), so not to override any of your previous configurations. Instead `init` is a lightweight command that only create the following:

- [`workspace.json`](/workspace//workspace-configuration) file, with base configuration.
- [`.bitmap`](/workspace/bitmap) to point to any component you share.
- A hidden `.bit` (or `.git/bit`) directory to store local scope <!-- [local scope](/scope/local-scope) --> for your components.

Once Bit is initialized on your project, you can run Bit commands and start the local dev server. <!-- [local dev server](/workspace/ui) -->

```bash
bit start
```

## Installing dependencies

We recommend using Bit to install dependencies on your workspace. This way you can use the component-specific dependency management capabilities Bit offers.

```bash
bit install
```

The `install` command reads and respects all dependencies defined in your `package.json` as well as the `workspace.jsonc` file.

:::info When using package managers directly

If you choose not to use Bit to manage dependencies in the project, ensure to add `bit compile && bit link` to your `package.json` as `post-install` scripts.

## Sharing components

The process for taking an existing component, which is currently coupled your project, and add it to be a Bit component has several additional steps than just using the `create` command.

First of all, decide which component you aim to share and decouple from the project. Know that here, if the component has any dependencies, you will likely to need to share them as well, or have them as part of the component. Once you had a target in mind, create a new Bit component:

Follow the steps for [creating a new component](/getting-started/composing/spec-breakdown):

<!-- ```bash
ther``` -->

When you have the Bit component created, port over the implementation to the newly created component. Now that you have the component's functionality decoupled from the project, use the various features Bit offers to ensure it's fully functional.

```bash
bit start       # to see the component rendered in isolation
bit compile     # to ensure compilation is successful
bit test        # run all tests in isolation
bit check-types # validate type script types
```

When the component is isolated and functioning, the next step is to replace the implementation in your project and simply add an `import` statement to your the new component.

:::tip Alternate path

Alternatively, you can use the `bit add` command to share components. Note that you will still have to decouple the component and ensure all dependencies are Bit components.

## Bit inside a monorepo

If your project is using any monorepo tool, ensure you still run `bit init` at the root directory of your project. Not in any of the sub-projects of the monorepo.  
It is recommended to use Bit to track components from any sub-project, keep a single `.bitmap` and `workspace.jsonc` files for managing configuration and workflow.
