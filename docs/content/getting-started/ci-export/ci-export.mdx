# Setup CI

## Get a Bit token

The first thing to do is get a Bit token that has access to scopes.  
You can create a dedicated user such as `dev@company.com` for the deployment, or use an existing user's token.

> If you are using an existing user's token, follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/teambit/docs/blob/harmony/docs/bit-dot-dev/authentication.md#additional-tokens) to generate a token that does not expire on local logins.

To get your token run the following command:

```shell
bit config get user.token
```

Set `user.token` as an environment parameter on your server named `BIT_TOKEN`.

## Version and export components from CI

To ensure a component is built and published in a consistent manner its recommended to use CI.  
The `tag` command versions components, but as this is a local command, we need to provide it with the parameters to run on a remote server. Bit features a **soft** and **persist** options for `tag` to manage a remote runs for component versioning as follows:

1. In your project run `bit tag` with the `--soft` option to annotate that modified components should be versioned and exported.
1. Bit will update `.bitmap` with information on which components should be versioned.
1. Commit changes and publish a pull request to your Git repository.
1. Get results of the PR build and collaborate on the soon-to-be published components.
1. Merge changes to main branch.
1. CI versions all marked components and publish them.
1. CI commits back to the repository the updated `.bitmap` in a post-export state.

Below are the steps you should follow to automate component export.

### Install and authenticate Bit

Your CI container should have Bit installed and authenticated with your remote Bit server(s). You can use `bvm` to install Bit.  
Authenticating Bit depends on how you host your Bit servers. If using a self-hosted Bit server you should manage authentication as you set it up for yourself.  
If using [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) grab your authentication token by running `bit config` after you ran `bit login`.

### "soft" tag components

When your feature branch is done and you want to mark which components are published, their next version and a changelog message use `--soft` option.

```sh title="soft tag components"
bit tag --soft --all --message "my message"
```

Bit then update `.bitmap` for all modified components and their dependents with the new version and the changelog message. Commit changes and push your branch.

```sh
git commit -am "my message" && git push
```

### Build modified components

When developing in a local workspace Bit prioritize performance and dev experience for the test and build process of each component. When you open a PR with changes to components it's recommended for Bit to run the entire isolation process for each component. To run a component complete build pipeline and have Bit ensure component isolation run the `build` command:

```sh title="build command prioritize isolation over performance"
bit build
```

Use the PR to collaborate on components and merge changes to main branch.

### Merge, version and publish

When soft-tagged components are merged to the main branch your CI should run the `tag` command to version and publish the components.

```sh title="persist soft tags"
bit tag --persist
```

After new versions are persisted to Bit's storage you can safely export:

```sh title="export components"
bit export
```

### Commit back to the repository

The aforementioned steps would cause `.bitmap` file to be updated. It's important to commit back these changes to the repository.

```sh title="commit changes to repository"
git add .bitmap
git commit -m "update .bitmap with new component versions (automated). [skip-ci]"
git push
```

:::info using `skip-ci`
Ensure your CI system has a feature to skip-ci on the commit-back step, otherwise your CI will try to run another CI step without your intention.

### Examples

Below are some examples/references to help you get started with your CI.

:::note
Below examples assume you use [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) to host your components.

#### Using GitHub actions

> You can also follow along with this [example project.](https://github.com/teambit/harmony-with-github-actions)

1. Create a new [secret variable](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) in your Github repository. Name it `BIT_TOKEN` and set the value of it to the `user.token` value.
1. Create a new `tag-and-export.yml` file in your remote repository `./.github/workflows` directory.
1. Create your script.

Here's a demo script you can start with:

```yaml
# This workflow hard-tags and exports soft-tagged components
name: Tag and Export Components

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  tag-and-export:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '--skip-ci')"
    env:
      BIT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BIT_TOKEN }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js 12
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x
      - name: Install Bit Version Manager
        run: npm i -g @teambit/bvm
      - name: Install latest Bit version
        run: bvm install
      - name: add bvm bin folder to path
        run: echo "$HOME/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
      - name: Set up bit config
        run: |
          bit config set analytics_reporting false
          bit config set anonymous_reporting false
          bit config set user.token $BIT_TOKEN
      - name: Install packages using bit
        run: bit install
      - name: Hard-tag pending components
        run: bit tag --persist
      - name: Export components
        run: bit export
      - name: Commit changes made to .bitmap
        run: |
          git config --global user.name '${{ github.actor }}'
          git config --global user.email '${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com'
          git add .bitmap
          git commit -m "update .bitmap with new component versions (automated). --skip-ci"
          git push
```

#### Using GitLab CI

1. Generate a Personal Access Token with "Read Repository" and "Write Repository" permissions (this will be `GL_TOKEN`).
1. Generate `BIT_TOKEN` by grabbing it from your local "bit config" output.
1. Configure both tokens as project variables for your GitLab project and name them `GL_TOKEN` and `BIT_USER_TOKEN`.
1. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root of the repository.
1. Create your script.

Here's a demo script you can start with:

```yml
publish_components:
  image: node:latest
  only: master
  script:
    # Install Bit and configure permissions
    - npm i -g @teambit/bvm
    - bvm install
    - export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
    - bit config set analytics_reporting false
    - bit config set anonymous_reporting false
    - bit config set user.token $BIT_TOKEN
    # Install dependencies
    - bit install
    # Version all pending components
    - bit tag --persist
    # Export components
    - bit export
    # Setup Git and commit back .bitmap changes
    - git config --global user.email "some@email.address"
    - git config --global user.name "some ci account"
    - export GL_RELEASE_GITLAB_API_TOKEN=$GL_TOKEN
    # This checkout is a workaround for the "error: src refspec master does not match any." error
    - git checkout master
    # Add the modified ".bitmap" file
    - git add .
    # Replace origin with authenticated origin
    - git remote rm origin
    - git remote add origin https://[repo-owner]:$GL_RELEASE_GITLAB_API_TOKEN@gitlab.com/[repo-ower]/[repo-name].git
    # Using [skip ci] as its a feature for GitLab that will not trigger CI for this commit
    - git commit -am 'publish components [skip ci]'
    - git pull origin master
    - git push origin master
```

## Install components on CI

### Configure npmrc on CI

Bit components are stored on the bit registry located in `https://node.bit.dev`.

When installing components with npm or yarn, they will try to install the components starting with `@<account-name>` by resolving the `@<account-name>` registry. This configuration is stored in an `.npmrc` configuration file. Npm and yarn respect the following file locations:

- per-project config file (`/path/to/my/project/.npmrc`)
- per-user config file (`~/.npmrc`)
- global config file (`$PREFIX/etc/npmrc`)
- npm builtin config file (`/path/to/npm/npmrc`)

When working locally, `bit login` configures this file automatically for you. You will need to set this file manually for your CI. If not done right you will get these errors:

**NPM**

```shell
failed running npm install at /Users/user/devenv/example-npm-error/components/utils/string/pad-left
npm ERR! code E404
npm ERR! 404 Not Found: @teambit/utils.string.pad-left@0.0.1
```

**Yarn**

```shell
failed running yarn install at /Users/user/devenv/example-npm-error/components/utils/string/pad-left
error An unexpected error occurred: "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@teambit%2fbit.utils.string.pad-left: Not found".
```

The error is solved by making sure that one of the `.npmrc` files has the configuration prior to running npm install. The solutions vary per vendor (see below), but the main methods are:

- Define `.npmrc` in the project.
- Generate `.npmrc` file for the CI user
- Extend `.npmrc` configuration with vendor's tools

### Manually create npmrc file

You can add a `.npmrc` in your project with the following:

```shell
@<account-name>:registry=https://node.bit.dev
@teambit:registry=https://node.bit.dev
//node.bit.dev/:_authToken=${BIT_TOKEN}
always-auth=true
```

Define `BIT_TOKEN` as a secret global variable on the server.

### Generate .npmrc on the CI server

Run the following script to generate the `.npmrc` file, dynamically (e.g. create a `bit_npm.sh` script):

```shell
echo "Adding bit.dev to npm registry"
echo "always-auth=true" >> ~/.npmrc
echo "@<account-name>:registry=https://node.bit.dev" >> ~/.npmrc
echo "@teambit:registry=https://node.bit.dev" >> ~/.npmrc
echo "//node.bit.dev/:_authToken={$BIT_TOKEN}" >> ~/.npmrc
echo "Completed adding bit.dev to npm registry"
```

### Netlify

On Netlify, [you cannot generate the file dynamically](https://community.netlify.com/t/common-issue-using-private-npm-modules-on-netlify/795/11). Instead, [manually add the `.npmrc` file](#manually-create-npmrc-file) to your project.

Add the BIT_TOKEN as [environment variable](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#environment-variables)

### Vercel

Learn how to use [private dependencies with Vercel](https://vercel.com/support/articles/using-private-dependencies-with-vercel) and add the contents of your `~/.npmrc` file as an [environment variable](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables).

### Gitlab

In `.gitlab-ci.yml` run the script that [generates the file for the user](#generate-.npmrc-on-the-ci-server) as an initial step before running npm install.

Add the BIT_TOKEN as an [environment variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)

### GitHub actions

Add the BIT_TOKEN as a [secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in GitHub.

In the GitHub workflow file, create a step before the npm install section:

```shell
- name: init bit.cloud
  run: |
    echo "Adding bit.dev to npm registry"
    npm config set @<owner>:registry=https://node.bit.dev
    npm config set @teambit:registry=https://node.bit.dev
    npm config set //node.bit.dev/:_authToken ${BIT_TOKEN}
    echo "Completed adding bit.dev to npm registry"
  env:
    BIT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.BIT_TOKEN }}
```

### Heroku

To generate the `.npmrc` before installing dependencies, run a pre-build script as described [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#heroku-specific-build-steps).

Add the `BIT_TOKEN` as an [environment variable](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#managing-config-vars)

### Azure pipelines

Use the [npm authenticate task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/package/npm-authenticate?view=azure-devops) to setup the `.npmrc` configuration in your pipeline.

### Common errors

#### 'package not found' (404) when importing a component

NPM or Yarn throws 'package not found' when importing a component. This is likely because the component has a dependency on a @bit component. Make sure [npmrc is configured](/packages/npmrc).

#### Unauthorized (401) when installing a component

Possible reasons:

- npmrc is not properly [configured](/packages/npmrc)
- You do not have the right permissions on the scope that the components are hosted in, and are therefore unable to access its components. Make sure you have at least read permissions for the scope that host the components.
- Yarn does not send an authentication token when installing packages from a `yarn.lock` file. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4451). Make sure `always-auth` is [configured in `.npmrc`](/packages/npmrc).
