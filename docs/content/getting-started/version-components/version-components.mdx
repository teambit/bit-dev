# Snapping components

A component in Bit has its own history. This history contains code, dependencies and configuration changes, together they form the [Component Snapshot](docs/components/snaps). Snapshots are shared using a remove Bit scope.

Each snap has to be completely isolated from the workspace. To evaluate if a state of a component can be saved, run:

```bash
bit status
```

If you see all component status as `ok`, Bit can save that state for the component.

Snapshots (snaps) are point in time for a component which you want to keep or share for various reasons. Each snapshot is immutable, meaning that once set, similar to a git-commit, it can't be changed.

To record our first snapshot we use the `snap` command:

```bash
bit snap ui/text --message "a demo snapshot"
```

The `tag` command creates a snap that has a unique semantic version pointer:

```bash
bit tag ui/my-welcome --message "my changelog message"
```

All snaps are stored in the local scope. The process of sharing components to remote Bit scopes is about exporting staged snaps from the local store to the remote.

Read more about [snapshots](/docs/components/snaps) or [tags](/docs/components/tags) and how to use them.

## Component history

With each component having it's own versioning and history you get a time-machine for components. You can see it in past working states, run diffs and even checkout a past version of a component to your workspace for maintenance.  

<Image alt="changelog" src={changelog} />

And by running the `log` command:

```bash
bit log ui/my-welcome
```

Read more about [navigating history](/docs/components/navigating-history).

### View past snaps

The workspace UI features a dropdown list of the component version history. You can pick any of the past versions and explore all the changes that happened in that version. This works like having a time-machine for your components.

### Comparing with past snaps

You may compare the current state of a component with past snap or version. To do so, run:

```bash
bit diff ui/my-welcome 1.0.0
```

## Undo snapshots

We can untag staged components, i.e., components that were tagged by not yet exported to a remote scope.  
Bit untag reverts the component to its previous state, i.e., `new`, `modified` or `exported`.

> Untag does not revert code changes made in the component.

Use `bit untag` to untag a component:

```bash title="examples for untag"
bit untag teambit.base-ui/button # untag a specific component
bit untag --all # untag all staged components
```

## Apply a semantic version

You can tag a state of a component with a semantic version. Behind the scenes Bit will create a snap which will then be marked with a version, so you are not required to create a snap and then apply a version for it.  
A component's version is set according to the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) specs. Meaning - version is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. By default, tagging a component without specifying a version bumps a patch version.

```bash
bit tag ui/my-welcome --message "my changelog message"
```

You can also tag all new/modified components in the workspace:

```bash
bit tag --all
```

You can specify a SemVer increment, so Bit tags all the components using that increment. Bit supports `patch`, `minor` and `major` increments.

```bash
bit tag "ui/*" --patch --message "my version message" # Version components matching the pattern with a patch vesion.
```

Read more on [versioning components](/docs/components/tags).

### Version Affected Components

Bit understands the dependency graph of all components in a workspace. When tagging a component, it will also tag all components that are affected by the change. This means that you not only make sure all dependents get updated, you also do it in the most efficient way possible where the minimal amount of code gets rebuilt.  
Dependent components will get promoted by a semantic patch version.
