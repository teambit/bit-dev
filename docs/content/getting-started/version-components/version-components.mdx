# Snapping components

By setting a version for a component you build a history of changes to a component's implementation. This version history can be shared through a remote Bit server.

## Snapping components



## Tagging components

Bit versions components it can isolate. To evaluate if a component can be versioned run:

```bash
bit status
```

If you see all component status as `ok`, Bit will version the component.

To tag the component, use `tag` command:

```bash
bit tag ui/my-welcome --message "my changelog message"
```

You can also tag all new/modified components in the workspace:

```bash
bit tag --all
```

### Semantic versioning

A component's version is set according to the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) specs. Meaning - version is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. By default, tagging a component without specifying a version bumps a patch version.

```shell
bit tag ui/my-welcome 1.0.0
```

You can specify a SemVer increment, so Bit tags all the components using that increment. Bit supports `patch`, `minor` and `major` increments.

```shell
bit tag --all --major --message "my version message" # Version all modified and new components with a major version.
bit tag --all --minor --message "my version message" # Version all modified and new components with a minor version.
```

Like most commands in Bit you can use pattern matching to tag multiple components.

```bash
bit tag "ui/*" --patch --message "my version message" # Version components matching the pattern with a patch vesion.
```

### Snapping affected components

Bit understands the dependency graph of all components in a workspace. When tagging a component, it will also tag all components that are affected by the change. This means that you not only make sure all dependents get updated, you also do it in the most efficient way possible where the minimal amount of code gets rebuilt.  
Dependent components will get promoted by a semantic patch version.

## Component history

With each component having it's own versioning and history you get a time-machine for components. You can see it in past working states, run diffs and even checkout a past version of a component to your workspace for maintenance.  
Component tags is what building this history. The workspace UI builds a changelog for each component and even lets you view past versions. Each component has a changelog tab:

<Image alt="changelog" src={changelog} />

And by running the `log` command:

```bash
bit log ui/my-welcome
```

### View past snaps

The workspace UI features a dropdown list of the component version history. You can pick any of the past versions and explore all the changes that happened in that version. This works like having a time-machine for your components.

<Image alt="version picker" src={versionPicker} />

### Comparing with past versions

You may compare the current state of a component with past version. To do so, run:

```bash
bit diff ui/my-welcome 1.0.0
```

### Navigating in component history

While the UI lets you view a component version from the past, using the CLI you can checkout a version of a component to your workspace. To do so, run:

```bash
bit checkout 0.0.1 ui/my-welcome
```

Bit will then revert the entire component directory to a past state.

## Undo snaps and tags

We can untag staged components, i.e., components that were tagged by not yet exported to a remote scope.  
Bit untag reverts the component to its previous state, i.e., `new`, `modified` or `exported`.

> Untag does not revert code changes made in the component.

Use `bit untag` to untag a component:

```bash title="examples for untag"
bit untag foo/bar # untag a specific component
bit untag foo/bar 1.0.0 # untag a specific version of a component
bit untag --all 0.11.4 # untag a specific version from all components that has that version
bit untag --all # untag all staged components
```

## Versioning process

When tagging a component or multiple components, Bit performs the actions below:

- Create a network of all component capsules.
- Run the build pipeline (`bit build`) as defined in each component's env in the capsule.
- Locking dependencies versions for the components.
- Setting a version of the component.

### Staged Components

When a version is tagged it becomes **staged** to be exported. All staged versions are logged and managed in a local storage called **scope**.  
For each staged version Bit keeps:

- Implementation of the component.
- Component configuration and env.
- Full dependency graph.
- Generated artifacts from the build pipeline.

The scope is located in `.git/bit` directory for each workspace. When exporting components to remote The process of sharing components to remote Bit servers is about exporting staged versions to a remote Bit server (that hosts a remote scope).
