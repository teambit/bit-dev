# Create a Remote Scope

Scope is a collboration server for components. Bit uses Scopes to allow for collboration of components wherever they are used.  
Set Remote scopes on Bit.cloud or self-hosted Bit servers to share components.

Each scope acts as a repostiory for components and exposes GraphQL API and Web UI and can be extended through with [Scope Aspects](/).

You can choose whether to host your Scope on bit.cloud or on your own.

## Host scope on bit.cloud

Bit is connected to [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) as its default hosting provider. Run the `login` command for Bit to open a login/sign-up form for a new personal account.

```bash
bit login
```

Once an account has been created successfully, your terminal will greet you with the following message:

```bash
success! logged in as <account name>
```

After you created your account, head over to the [create scope](https://bit.cloud/~create-scope) page to create a new scope.

1. Choose your account.
1. Type your scope name.
1. Click on "Create".

## Deploy a self-hosted scope

Self hosting your own scope requires provisioning a dedicated container either locally, on kubernetes or any cloud provider you use.

Follow [these steps](/docs/scope/running-a-scope-server) to provision a scope server for your components.

## Rename components to fit the a scope name

Once you have setup a remote scope you may need to change the `workspace.jsonc` to reflect the correct account and scope.

- Open the `workspace.jsonc` file
- Find the line `"defaultScope": "my-scope"`
- Replace it with your username/organization name, and 'demo-scope' as your scope

```js
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "defaultScope": "your-username.demo-scope"
  }
}
```

s we have changed the default scope we now need to make sure our node modules are linked correctly. We can do that with the `link` command.

```bash
bit link
```

You will need to change different `import` statements between components to reflect the component name changes.

### Rest all components

In case you already have local versions with wrong remote scope names, you can reset components and mark them as "new":

```bash
bit init --reset-new
```

You can also use the `rename` component if you simply want to move components to a different scope and still retain history.
