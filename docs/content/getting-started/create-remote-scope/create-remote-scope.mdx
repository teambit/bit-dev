# Create a Remote Scope

Scope is a server for hosting for components. Bit uses Scopes to save versions of Bit Components and access them as needed. Set Remote scopes on Bit.cloud or self-hosted Bit servers to share components.

Each scope is a dedicated container with storage for components, GraphQL API as an API layer and Web UI for browsing components.

Regardless of how you choose to host and manage your scope, the local Bit flow remains the same.

## Host scope on Bit.cloud

Bit is connected to [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) as its default hosting provider. Run the `login` command for Bit to open a login/sign-up form for a new personal account.

```bash
bit login
```

Once an account has been created successfully, your terminal will greet you with the following message:

```bash
successfully added @bit as a scoped registry at /Users/<account>/.npmrc
success! logged in as <account name>
```

After you created your account, head over to the [create scope](https://bit.cloud/~create-scope) page to create a new scope.

1. Choose your account.
1. Type your scope name.
1. Click on "Create".

## Deploy a self-hosted scope

Self hosting your own scope requires provisioning a dedicated container either locally, on kubernetes or any cloud provider you use.

Follow [these steps](/docs/scope/running-a-scope-server) to provision a scope server for your components.

## Rename components to fit the a scope name

Once you have setup a remote scope you may need to change the `workspace.jsonc` to reflect the correct account and scope.

- Open the `workspace.jsonc` file
- Find the line `"defaultScope": "my-scope"`
- Replace it with your username/organization name, and 'demo-scope' as your scope

```js
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "defaultScope": "your-username.demo-scope"
  }
}
```

s we have changed the default scope we now need to make sure our node modules are linked correctly. We can do that with the `link` command.

```bash
bit link
```

You will need to change different `import` statements between components to reflect the component name changes.

### Rest all components

In case you already have local versions with wrong remote scope names, you can reset components and mark them as "new":

```bash
bit init --reset-new
```

You can also use the `rename` component if you simply want to move components to a different scope and still retain history.
