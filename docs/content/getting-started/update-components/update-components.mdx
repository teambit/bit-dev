# Update Components

There are several ways you may update your component. This guide walks through how to update components and measure the impact of your updates.

## Update Implementation

Updating implementation is as simple as editing the code of a component.
TODO

## Update Configuration

workspace.json
TODO

## Update Dependencies

Update your workspace dependencies by running the `install` command:

```sh
bit install
```

## Show Modified Components

To see how updating dependencies has affected each component run:

```bash title="See updated components"
bit status
```

Bit tracks which component it using any dependency, and shows you how the changes to installed dependencies affect each component.

```bash title="List of update components"
TODO - GET OUTPUT
```

We see that `COMPONENT` is modified, and as a result `COMPONENT` is pending to be tagged as well, since its dependency was modified.

### Component Diff

Bit uses Git to provide you with a diff for each component. You can use the `diff` command to see what are the exact changes made to a specific component.

```bash
bit diff COMPONENT
```

Component version contains code, configuration and dependencies, so the diff output gives us a complete glimpse of what has changed.

```bash title="Diff output"
TODO
```

## Build Affected Components

Bit keeps a dependency graph of all components so when a component is modified it knows to build it and its dependents only, instead of building all components in the workspace.
