# Update Components

When using components for collaboration it may happen that a remote component has been updated. When this happens, you need to fetch the remote updates and merge them to your codebase, to keep up with the team's progress.

When you run `bit install`, Bit also checks if there are any updates to your components. If there are updates, you will see a message like this:

```bash
successfully imported 1 components
- updated teambit.base-ui/button new versions: 1.0.1
```

Bit notifies on any new versions found for the components that exist in the local workspace.

Running bit status also shows pending changes for the component:

```bash
bit status
```

```bash
pending updates
(use "bit checkout [version] [component_id]" to merge changes)
(use "bit log [component_id]" to list all available versions)

    > teambit.base-ui/button: 1.0.0 latest: 1.0.1
```

## Show diff with the incoming update

Bit uses Git to provide you with a diff for each component. You can use the `diff` command to see what are the exact changes made to a specific component.

```bash
bit diff teambit.base-ui/button
```

Component version contains code, configuration and dependencies, so the diff output gives us a complete glimpse of what has changed.

## Checkout the update

To update your local component with the remote modifications you need to checkout the new version or snapshot. Alternatively, you can quickly checkout the latest version:

```bash
bit checkout latest teambit.base-ui/button
```

```bash
successfully switched teambit.base-ui/button to version 1.0.1
update base-ui/button/button.tsx
```

### Handle merge conflict

In case Git is unable to automatically merge the incoming changes with local changes in your component, you get prompted to resolve the conflict.

Bit will print a similar output to this:

```bash
successfully switched teambit.base-ui/input/button to version 1.0.5
updated base-ui/input/button.spec.ts
updated base-ui/input/index.ts
CONFLICT base-ui/input/button.ts automatic merge failed. please fix conflicts manually and then tag the results.
```

You can use the several options when `checkout` to resolve conflicts.

- `--theirs` - the remote version overrides the local modifications.
- `--ours` - the local implementation overrides the remote changes.
- `--manual` - resolve the conflict manually.

```bash
bit checkout latest teambit.base-ui/button --ours
```

Once merge is resolved, run `bit status` and see the result.

```bash
bit status
```

```status
modified components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > teambit.base-ui/input/button ... ok
```
