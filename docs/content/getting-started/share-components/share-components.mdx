# Exporting components

Exporting components to remote scopes makes them available for other developers to consume and collaborate. You can create remote scopes on your own server or manage components' scopes the [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) components hub.

As a prerequisite you need to create a remote scope, and ensure that you have write access to it. All components you aim to export should have the remote scope name as part of their component ID.

After you created staged [snaps](/components/snaps) or [versions](/components/tags). To validate you can safely export new versions, run the `status` command.

```bash
bit status
```

Here we see that our workspace has 4 components, and 2 of them have **staged versions**.

```bash
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > pages/welcome ... ok
     > ui/card ... ok
               
staged components
(use "bit export <remote_scope> to push these components to a remote scope")

     > ui/text. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
     > ui/heading. versions: 1.0.0 ... ok
```

Bit tells you exactly which components are pending to be exported. Export them to a remote scope with the `export` command:

```sh
bit export
```

Bit then lets you know how many components were exported.

```bash
2 components were exported to scope teambit/base-ui
```

## Viewing exported components

Exported components are hosted on the target scope. Each scope features a not only a **remote scope** for keeping all component versions. A remote scope features a web UI similar to the workspace UI in which all components are showcased.  
To see the all exported components open your browser and navigate to the Bit scope URL.
