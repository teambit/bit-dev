# Development Environments

Component development is simplified and standardized using [Component Development Environments](/envs/overview) (or **envs** in short). An env is a compositions of several [Services](/envs/services/overview).  
A service implementes an operation, for example: [Compiler](/compiler/overview), [Tester](/tester/overview), [Builder](/builder/overview), [Linter](/linter/overview), Bundler<!--TODO [Bundler](/bundler/overview) -->. Services use tool-specific implementations like [TypeScript](/typescript/overview) or [Jest](/jest/overview) and used from [Env](/envs/env) like 
[React](/react/overview) or [Node](/node/overview).  
Composed together with their configurations, they form an entire development experience. When shared between different teams and developers, they simplify and standardize the development process.

To check which envs are configured on your components you can use the `bit env` command or check the icon on its left on the UI.

```bash
bit env
```

```bash
┌───────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┐
│ component                             │ env                                   │
├───────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────┤
│ company.scope/templates/ui/text       │ teambit.bit/react                     │
├───────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────┤
│ company.scope/ui/my-welcome           │ teambit.bit/react                     │
└───────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Since we created this component under the `ui` namespace, the newly component created is configured to use 
the [React Env](/aspects/react). The [React Env](/aspects/react) is the official [Env](/envs/overview) 
for development of React Components. It comes baked with best practices from the React community and makes it easy and repeatable to create and maintain React components. By default, the [React Env](/aspects/react) is configured to use Typescript <!--TODO [TypeScript](/typescript/overview)--> for compiling, [ESLint](/linter/overview) for linting, <!--TODO [Jest](/jest/overview)--> Jest for testing and a contains a basic build pipeline.

:::info Benefits of Component Environments

- Clean your codebase from configuration files.
- Versioning for your build pipeline and tooling configuration.
- Standardize build process by reusing the same settings on many components.
- Apply unique build process on each component.

## Developer Workflow Commands and Services

[Environment Services](/envs/services/overview) define what tools would run and their configs. These services correspond to the different Bit commands you can use while building with Bit.


### `start`

The workspace UI displays your components. The component's env defines the configuration for the dev-server rendering documentation and compositions. Run workspace UI and see the list of dev-servers operated by the different environments. All dev-servers are then presented in the same app using iFrames for compositions (so both Angular and React components can be rendered in the same app).

```sh
bit start
```

```sh title="Running workspace UI with components configured with 2 envs"
ENVIRONMENT NAME                    URL                                          STATUS
teambit.react/react                 http://localhost:3300                        RUNNING
teambit.harmony/node                http://localhost:3301                        RUNNING


You can now view 'my workspace' components in the browser.
Bit server is running on http://localhost:3000
```

### `compile`

Bit allows a single command to compile all components in your workspace, regardless to the specific Compiler configured to them. For example, this allows some of your components to be compiles with [TypeScript](/aspects/typescript) and others with [Babel](/aspects/babel) (or different configs for the same compiler as different envs might use different `tsconfig.json` or `.babelrc.js`).

```sh
bit compile
```

```bash
  STATUS  COMPONENT ID
✔ SUCCESS templates/envs/my-react # Using the Aspect env which is set to use the `Babel` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/pages/welcome # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/ui/card # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/ui/heading # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS templates/ui/text # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.
✔ SUCCESS ui/my-welcome # Using the React env which is set to use the `TypeScript` Compiler.

✔ 6/6 components compiled successfully.
Finished. (3s)
```

`bit watch` uses the same operation as `compile`.

```bash
bit watch
```

To learn more on Compiler, head to over to the [Compiler documentation](/compiler/overview).

### `test`

Running tests for components built with purposes may result in requiring vastly different configurations and approaches. For example, for UI components you may want to set visual regression testing, while for utils this is less relevant. Some components may also need different testers.  
The [tester](/tester/overview) service knows to run tests and extract their results to a standardized format to be presented in the UI.

```bash
bit test
```

```bash
testing total of 6 components in workspace 'my-workspace'
testing 5 components with environment company.scope/templates/envs/my-react

 PASS  ui/my-welcome/my-welcome.spec.tsx
 PASS  templates/pages/welcome/welcome.spec.tsx

:::info Run Tests in Watch Mode

```bash

:::info Tests Results in `bit start`

When using `bit start` as your development environment, the UI will display the test results.

### `lint`

Depending on the environment configured on components, components in the same workspace may have different linting rules. Still, the operation itself is the same as all other services.

```bash
bit lint
bit lint --fix
```

To learn more about linting components and the Linter, head over to the [Linter documentation](/linter/overview) section.

### `format`

Depending on the environment configured on components, components in the same workspace may have different formatting rules. Still, the operation itself is the same as all other services.

```bash
bit format
```

To learn more about the Formatter, please head over to the [Formatter documentation](/formatter/overview) section.

### `build`

[Builder](/builder/overview) service composes the [build pipeline](/builder/build-pipelines) from tasks implemented by other [services](/envs/services/overview) such as [Compiler](/compiler/overview) or [Tester](/tester/overview).

```bash title="Run the build pipeline"
bit build
```
