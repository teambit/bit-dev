# Development Environments

A development environment (Env) is a collection of tools, procedures and configurations, used for the development of components. This includes component documentation, compilation, testing, building and more.

An env is a single component. You can collaborate on it, reuse it, and even extend it in your own custom env composition.

<ComponentCardDisplay
  componentIds={[
    'teambit.react/react',
    'teambit.angular/angular',
    'teambit.mdx/mdx',
    'teambit.html/html',
    'teambit.web-components/lit',
    'teambit.harmony/node',
    'teambit.harmony/aspect',
  ]}

## Using an env

Envs are used by components - not by workspaces (for this reason, a single workspace can run multiple envs at once). To use an env, create a component to apply that env on:

```bash
bit create react ui/button
```

The output confirms that a new component was created. This component is already set (by its [template](/dev-services/generator/generate-component)) to use Bit's React env:

```bash
my-org.my-scope/ui/button
    location: my-scope/ui/button
    env:      teambit.react/react (set by template)
```

To set a different env, run the following:

```bash
bit env set COMPONENT_ID_PATTERN ENV_ID
```

For example, the following sets the component with [a custom env](#creating-a-custom-env):

```bash
bit env set ui/button my-org.my-scope/my-react
```

The output confirms that the new component is set with the custom env:

```bash
added my-org.my-scope/envs/my-react env to the following component(s):
my-org.my-scope/ui/button
```

:::info Overriding the default env set by a template
To override the default env set by the [component template](/dev-services/generator/generate-component) use the `--env` option. For example:

```bash
bit create react ui/button --env my-org.my-scope/my-react
```

Learn how to run an env's dev services in the ['Running dev services'](#running-dev-services) section.

## Creating a custom env

Bit offers various out-of-the-box envs that you can use directly but also, as part of your own custom env composition.
For example, run the following to create an env that extends Bit's React env:

```bash
bit create react-env envs/my-react
```

<ExtendedEnv />

The output confirms that a new component was created. And, since that component is an env, it uses an env designed for envs.

```bash
1 component(s) were created

my-org.my-scope/envs/my-react
    location: my-scope/envs/my-react
    env:      teambit.envs/env (set by template)
```

Head over to your env's `my-react.main.ts` file to change React's default config using its extension API.
For example, set Prettier (React's default formatter) to use a tab-width of 4 instead of 2:

```ts
react.usePrettier({
  transformers: [
    (config) => {
      config.setKey('tabWidth', 4);
      return config;
    },
  ],
});
```

Run the following to compile the new env and install its dependencies:

```bash
bit install && bit compile
```

Head over to the ['Using an env'](#using-an-env) section, to learn how to use your custom env.

## Running dev services

Dev services are component development procedures that are provided by envs. Even though different envs provide different implementations of these dev services, they all use the same standardized interfaces.

For example, run the following command to compile your components' code:

```ts
bit compile
```

The output lists all components affected by the compilation. Notice how the custom env and the component that uses it, were both compiled. That is so, even though each of them uses a different env.

```bash
  STATUS        COMPONENT ID
✔ SUCCESS       envs/my-react
✔ SUCCESS       ui/button
```
