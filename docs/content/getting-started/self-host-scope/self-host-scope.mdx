# Self Host Scope

When self-hosting Bit on your own infrastructure you will also need to publish components to an external registry so components will be available to install with package managers.

## Creating your own Server

To create your own remote server you will need to provision your own server and run the `bit init --bare` command. This will create a bare scope that you can use to host your own components.

```bash
mkdir my-server
cd my-server
bit init --bare
```

### Start your Server

To start your server you can run the `bit start` command.

```bash
bit start
```

This will open up the server on the available port eg. `http://localhost:3001`. You will notice that it is an empty remote scope as no components have been exported yet.

### Update your Default Scope

In the `workspace.jsonc` file in the project where your components are, change the default scope to be the name of your server.

```json title=workspace.jsonc
{
  "defaultScope": "my-server"
}
```

### Add your Remote Scope

On any computer you want to export to your scope configure the remote:

```bash
bit remote add http://localhost:3001 # url of the scope
```

## Publish your Components to NPM

The `teambit.pkg/pkg` is added to the variants section in your `workspace.jsonc` file. We can apply this to all components by using the `"{*}"` wildcard or to a specific set of components. This gives us better control over publishing our components as we can decide which ones we want to publish and to which remote scopes. `teambit.pkg/pkg` is used for managing `package.json` for components.

```json {4} title=workspace.jsonc
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "{ui/**}": {
      // add component environment here, React/Angular/Node etc
      "teambit.pkg/pkg": {}
    }
}
```

### Make your Components Public

If you want to make your package a public package on npm add `["--access public"]` to the value for `packageManagerPublishArgs`.

```json {4-6} title=workspace.jsonc
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "{ui/**}": {
      // add component environment here, React/Angular/Node etc
      "teambit.pkg/pkg": {
        "packageManagerPublishArgs": [
          "--access public"
        ],
      }
    }
}
```

### Override the `package.json`

We can override the properties of the `package.json` for all our components at once. To do this we add the `"packageJson"` key and inside our object we add any of the properties we want to override. For the name property we add the dynamic value `"@{scope}/{name}"`. This will take the scope value from the `defaultScope` property in the `workspace.jsonc` file and append it to the name of your component.

```json {8-11} title=workspace.jsonc
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "{ui/**}": {
      // add component environment here, React/Angular/Node etc
      "teambit.pkg/pkg": {
        "packageManagerPublishArgs": [
          "--access public"
        ],
        "packageJson": {
          "name": "@{scope}/{name}",
          "private": false
        }
      }
    }
}
```

:::tip Add other key/value pairs
You can add other key/value pairs to the `package.json` file. For example you can add a `"license"` property to specify the license of your package.
:::

### Setting the Scope and registry

In order to publish our components to the npm registry we first must [login to npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and add a new **organization/scope** in npm. We can then add the name of this **organization/scope** to the `publishConfig` property under our `"packageJson"`" key. We then need to add the registry url to the `registry` property which in this case is the url to the npm registry.

```json {11-14} title=workspace.jsonc
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "{ui/**}": {
      // add component environment here, React/Angular/Node etc
      "teambit.pkg/pkg": {
        "packageManagerPublishArgs": [
          "--access public"
        ],
        "packageJson": {
          "name": "@{scope}/{name}",
          "private": false,
          "publishConfig": {
            "scope": "@test-remote",
            "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
```

:::note
Here we are publishing to npmjs.org, but it's also possible to publish to Artifactory, Nexus or Verddacio.

### Logging in to npm

In the terminal login to npm so that you can use Bit to publish your components to npm.

```bash
npm login
```

## Building a Scope Network

If you build components with several scopes in your projects that have cross-dependencies, you will need to configure remote scopes for each scope. The steps for it are:

1. Provision a server and initialize a remote Bit scope for each component-scope.
1. Start the server for each scope with `bit start-scope` command.
1. In each server run `bit remote add <url>` for each of the other remote scopes.
1. In each client machine run `bit remote add <url>` to all scopes.
