# Create a new Workspace

You can use Bit to manage your developer workspace of components with the [Bit Workspace](/workspace/workspace-overview). It is where you build and compose components.

Quickly get started with Bit by creating a workspace from a template. Use templates to ramp-up a new project with a set of base components, configurations and dependencies. See all available templates by running the following command:

```bash
bit templates
```

:::tip Create your scope

We recommend creating a remote [Scope](/scope/scope-overview) as a target for exporting your components.

Either [create a free Scope on the Bit Cloud](https://bit.cloud) or [host your own Scope](/scope/running-a-scope-server).

:::

Create a new workspace from a template with the `new` command. This example uses the `--default-scope` feature and passes the default remote scope for the workspace. When creating scopes in [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud), all scopes are pre-fixed with their `owner`.

```bash
bit new react my-workspace --default-scope bitorg.experience
```

To learn in depth on [Creating Workspace head here](/workspace/creating-workspaces).

Congrats! You have created a Bit Workspace. You should get a similarly structured set of files and directories:

```bash
├── .git/bit --> Local Scope associated with the Workspace.
├── .bitmap
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── pnpm-lock.yaml --> chosen package manager lock file
├── node_modules --> includes external workspace modules and Workspace Component Links.
├── public
│   └── ... --> The Workspace public assets, generated upon new Aspect configuration or the first time.
├── types --> `types` directory generated as Workspace files generated by the template.
│   ├── asset.d.ts
│   └── style.d.ts
├── tsconfig.json --> Workspace file defined in the template.
├── .eslintrc.js --> Workspace file defined in the template.
└── workspace.jsonc --> main configuration file for the Workspace
```

Notice that Bit itself has a minimal footprint. Bit only needs to files to control configuration and build pipeline for all components.  
Most templates will likely generate the following files:

- [`.bitmap`](/workspace/structure/bitmap) - maps Bit Components to their [Component Directories](/workspace/structure/component-directory).
- [`workspace.jsonc`](/workspace/workspace-configuration) - Main configuration file for the Bit Workspace.
- `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `types` directory and other base files to sync your IDE with components.
- `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` - External dependencies and a corresponding lock file managed by pnpm as the package manager.
- `.git` - Newly initiated Git repository (can be skipped with the `--skip-git` flag).
- `.git/bit` - [Local Scope](/scope/scope-overview) associated with the Workspace.

See the status of all components in the workspace.

```bash
bit status
```

```bash
new components
(use "bit tag --all [version]" to lock a version with all your changes)

     > templates/envs/my-react ... ok
     > templates/pages/welcome ... ok
     > templates/ui/card ... ok
     > templates/ui/heading ... ok
     > templates/ui/text ... ok
```

Notice all components are under the `new` category. This category is for components that were just created and does not have any past versions. Each of the components is also marked as `ok`, which means that Bit is unable to find any issues with the components. There may be different statuses for components, which direct you to fix dependency resolution or other issues. Learn more on the different [workspace statuses](/workspace/workspace-status).

Workspace comes with a local dev server <!-- [local dev server](/workspace/workspace-ui) --> to help with building your components. It helps during development and ease common development tasks as documentation, discovery, testing, visualization, dependency management, explore history and other capabilities. You can use the Workspace UI alongside other development tools. <!-- Bit runs a dev server for each type of components, according to their configuration. [readmore](/bundlers/dev-servers) -->

Start the local workspace UI with the following command:

```bash
bit start
```

As the local set of servers spins up, Bit will open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

<Image atl="workspace ui" src={workspaceUi} />

In the component sidebar on the left, new components are marked with `N`, for `new`.

### Workspace directory structure

Bit has a default [directory structure](/workspace/structure/directory-structure) for the workspace. Components are sorted according to their [scopes](/scope/scope-overview) to help define team boundaries and ownerships. Each scope is a directory, where components are sorted inside of them in sub-directories according to their namespaces. <!-- [namespaces](/workspace/namespaces) -->
Bit requires a component to have it's own [Component Directory](/workspace/structure/component-directory). This directory may have many files and sub-directories.

<!-- To learn more on [Repository Architecture head over here](/understanding-bit/repository-architecture/overview). -->

```bash
templates --> `Scope` used to define team boundaries and ownership
├── ...
├── pages --> `Component Namespaces` to assist with organization and configuration of components used
│   └── welcome --> `Component Directory` includes a specific Component implantation.
│       ├── index.ts
│       ├── welcome.spec.tsx
│       ├── welcome.composition.tsx
│       ├── welcome.docs.mdx
│       ├── welcome.module.scss
│       └── welcome.tsx
└── ui

    │   ├── card.module.scss
    │   ├── card.spec.tsx
    │   ├── card.tsx
    │   └── index.ts
    └── ...
```

:::tip Control workspace structure

Directory structures in the Bit Workspace are fully flexible and can structured in any way. The only hard limit is that each Component has to have it's own directory. To learn more on structuring Workspaces head over to [Directory Structure](/workspace/structure/directory-structure) section.

### Configure your Workspace name and icon

Configure specific properties for your workspace, like `name` and `icon` in the [`workspace.jsonc`](/workspace/workspace-configuration) file, in the `teambit.workspace/workspace` Aspect.

```json
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "My first Bit Workspace",
    "icon": "https://static.bit.dev/bit-logo.svg",
  }
```

### External dependencies

You can install [external dependencies](/dependencies/external-dependencies) to your workspace. They can be other packages or components. Use the `install` command to install dependencies and keep your workspace up to date with new versions.  
Dependencies are added to the [Dependency Policy](/dependencies/dependency-policies) part in your `workspace.jsonc`.

Run a fresh install for all dependencies:

```bash
bit install
```

To add a new external dependency to your workspace:

```bash
bit install @teambit/base-ui.button
```

In addition to installing dependencies, the `install` command also keeps your workspace up-to-date with [Component Objects](/components/structure/component-objects) and generate [Workspace Component Links](/workspace/structure/component-links).  
We recommend running `install` after pulling remote changes, to ensure your workspace is up-to-date.

### Configure aspects on the workspace

Aspects are Bit features you can add to your workspace or components. They are distributed as components. Add an aspect to your workspace by editing the `workspace.jsonc` file and add the aspect name as a top level key.

```json
{
  "owner.scope/some-extension": {}
}
```

### Debugging in the workspace

[Base Templates](/dev-services-overview/generator/generate-workspace) comes built in with an example launch.json for [VSCode Debugging Configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging). To learn more on IDE debugger configuration head here.
