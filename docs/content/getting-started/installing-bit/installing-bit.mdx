# Installing Bit

Bit has been designed from the start for gradual adoption and has a minimal footprint. You can use components as much or as little as you need.
  Bit can be used to share components from existing projects or start a new component-driven project with Bit.

<!-- Installing Bit is recommended using [BVM](/bvm/introduction), Bit's version manager.  -->

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```
<!-- TODO: teambit.bit/blocks/installation -->
<!-- TODO: move to deeper dive -->
<!-- **NodeJS**

Bit uses a built-in installation of NodeJS. It does not affect the version of NodeJS running your app.
You can also point Bit to use your own version of NodeJS. -->

<!-- 
```bash
bit config nodejs_path /usr/local/bit/node
``` -->
<!-- TODO: gilad, add configuration to configure Bit to use your own -->

<!-- **Git** -->

<!-- Bit comes built-in installation of Git. You can also either point Bit to use your own installation of Git. -->
