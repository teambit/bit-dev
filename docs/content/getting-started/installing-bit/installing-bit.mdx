# Installing Bit

Installing Bit is recommended using [BVM](/docs/bvm/introduction), Bit's version manager. 

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```

## Upgrading BVM

To upgrade to the latest version of BVM.

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm upgrade
```

## Manage versions

Get version information for Bit and BVM.

```bash
bvm version
```

List available versions of Bit and BVM.

```bash
bvm list --remote
```

List installed versions

```bash
bvm list
```

Remove a local version of Bit so it will fallback to a previous version.

```bash
bvm remove <bit-version>
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get a warning or the bvm command is not available please see the [BVM guide](/reference/bvm).
