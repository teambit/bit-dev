# Installing Bit

<Subtitle>Bit has been designed from the start for gradual adoption and has a minimal footprint. You can use components as much or as little as you need.
  Bit can be used to Librate components from existing projects or start a component-driven project with Bit.</Subtitle>

<!-- Installing Bit is recommended using [BVM](/bvm/introduction), Bit's version manager.  -->

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```
<!-- TODO: teambit.bit/blocks/installation -->
<!-- TODO: move to deeper dive -->
<!-- **NodeJS**

Bit uses a built-in installation of NodeJS. It does not affect the version of NodeJS running your app.
You can also point Bit to use your own version of NodeJS. -->
<!-- 
```bash
bit config nodejs_path /usr/local/bit/node
``` -->
<!-- TODO: gilad, add configuration to configure Bit to use your own -->

<!-- **Git** -->

<!-- Bit comes built-in installation of Git. You can also either point Bit to use your own installation of Git. -->

## Start a Bit powered workspace

You can start a new component-driven project with Bit. To do that, either head to [Quick start](/quick-start) or to 
[Start a new Bit workspace](/getting-started/installing-bit/start-bit-workspace) if you want a more in depth content.

## Share components from existing projects

If you are looking for liberating existing components from existing projects, head over to [Add to existing project](/getting-started/installing-bit/add-to-existing-project).

## Updating Bit

To update to the latest version of Bit, use:

```
npx @teambit/bvm upgrade
```

### I'm getting "command is not available" error

If you get a warning or the `bvm` command is not available you will need to run the code below.

- **Windows**
```bash
setx path "%path%;%LocalAppData%\.bvm"
```
- **MacOS/Linux** (Bash)
```bash
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```
- **MacOS/Linux** (ZSH)
```bash
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

### Prerequisites

You may encounter issues running Bit commands if either of these tools are not installed on your system.

- **NodeJS** - Bit requires NodeJS 14, 15 or 16 to be installed on your system.  
- **Git** - Bit uses Git for solving merge conflicts and other capabilities.
