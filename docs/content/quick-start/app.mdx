import { ComponentCardGroup } from '@teambit/explorer.ui.gallery.component-card-group';
import { contexts } from './wiki';

### What is the need?

The most important step towards building a great component, is understanding where and how the component would be used and what does each of the usages require from the component
interface. Understanding the need and identifying the

In our case, we chose the app name to be `dot-bit`. This is the name of our internal wiki. You can choose any name you like for your organization.

### Define the component

[Naming the component](/) is the first challenge for building any component, and the most important one. When naming your component you are actually defining its owner,
responsbility and goal.

- **Ownership.** Who will own the component.
- **Responsibility.** What kind this component is? What is the responsibility of the component?

Earlier we decided to give the ownership over the component to the `wiki` scope on the `my-org` organization in Bit Cloud and now we decided to name
our first component: `apps / wiki`.

| Ownership   | Responsibility        |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| my-org.wiki | apps / wiki-worldwide |

Components are identified and named using a unique identifier called ["Component ID"](/components/structure/component-id).

Now that we have defined the name, we can go ahead and create the component.

```bash
bit create react-app apps/wiki-worldwide
```

<!-- :::note
TODO: Support compile after create, and dependencies in templates. UNTIL THEN:
```bash
bit compile
bit install react-router@^5.0.0 @types/react-router@^5.0.0 react-router-dom@^5.0.0 @types/react-router-dom@^5.0.0
```
::: -->

Configure the app on your workspace configuration, via `workspace.json`:

```json
{
  "my-org.wiki/apps/wiki-worldwide": {}
}
```

<!-- TODO: guy automate app loading -->

Alternatively, you can `fork` the component from the demo above in to your project and start from there!

```bash
bit fork teambit.wiki/apps/wiki
```

<!-- TODO: david to deliver on fork -->

Run the app:

```bash
bit run wiki-worldwide
dot-bit app is running on http://localhost:3001
```

You should be open to open the browser now on the displayed port and expect an 'Hello World' text on the screen!

## Compose the component

Scaling component-driven is about agreements,

To compose this kind of an app, we would need few common things like a Theme and a Routing context.
There are common components that are contextual and affect every component we build.

### Contextual components

For this demo, we will use the following component. When distributing.

<!-- TODO: Kutner. include the theme provider -->

Build a theme of your own.

### Routing

<ComponentCardGroup components={contexts} />

<!-- TODO: Kutner. include the routing provider -->

Use a different routing solution. Or implement a provider.

Now what we have a working application, we need to use the header and the wiki components, and we have a better understanding of what
is required of them.

- Header.
- Wiki.
- Footer.
