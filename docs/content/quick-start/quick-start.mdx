# Quick start

<Subtitle>Welcome to the Bit documantation site! This site is built with Bit.</Subtitle>

## Introduction

This is a simple app, built with Bit.

### Learning Bit

There are few ways to get started with Bit.

- If you feel like **quickly learning what Bit is about**, head over to the [Thinking in Components](/thinking-in-components). This tutorial won't get you to understand
  all the technical details of Bit, but will get you a good feeling of what it is like building component-driven software with Bit.
- If you are **familiar with Bit and its concepts**, and want to dive deep into a specific topic, head over to the different chapters on the Learn section.

The rest of this page, will guide you step by step through the different concepts of Bit and will help navigate through the docs and decide
which concepts to dive deeper into.

During this quick start, you will build choose your own favourite inventions, and build them into a component with a simple search functionallity. Here is the product
spec.

## Installation

To get started, we would first have to make sure the `bit` binary is installed on your machine and configured to your `PATH`. 

```bash
$ npx @teambit/bvm install
```

// NodeJS installation is required.

### Creating the workspace

The first step in the Bit journey is to create a [component development workspace](/workspaces).
Workspaces allow the creation and maintanance of isolated and independent pieces called ["components"](/components). Since every component is isolated, the workspace is tech agnostic and allows
for components, with a different tech stack to co-exist. A single workspace might include React components, general purpose node modules, Angular modules 
and even backend services. 

To create a new workspace, run:
```bash
bit new great-inventions
```

```bash
cd my-workspace
```

Start the Workspace UI console:
```bash
bit start
```

:::tip
It is recommended to open an editor like VSCode on the workspace to start editing the components source code. To learn more on [editor setup head here](/editor-setup).
:::

The workspace was designed for gradual adoption and has a minimal footprint. Since components are isolated, Bit can easily co-exist next to other development tools, 
across different projects. This tutorial demonstrates creating a new workspace, to [start from an existing project head here](/add-to-existing-project).

In depth: Learn more about [Workspaces](/workspace/overview).

## Create the first component
With Bit, applications are built from isolated and independent pieces of source-code called ["components"](/components). A Bit component is a group of files in a workspace' directory, 
tracked for changes and isolated using a [development environment](/envs). A development environment is a set of dev tools, composed together to fit the build of a specific kind 
of component. This way, a React component can use the [React environment](/envs/node), Node modules could use the [Node environment](/envs/node), and new environments 
can be easily created to fit any type of component! 

Components are like small, and isolated repositories of source code that work symmetrically. 
Components are like repositories, which can work in symmetery from any Bit workspace. Components can be imported and exported from Scopes.

<!-- 
Components have metadata and configuration as well and they are identified by a unique ID called ["Component ID"](/components/component-id). 

Components can be anything as simple as a module or as large as an entire app. 
Building components starts bottom up. That means, you should only create the component you actually need to use now and implement the things required for your most
burning need. If you have a target application for the component, start with the component you would actually consume. -->

### Name the component

[Naming the component](/) is the first challenge for building any component, and the most important one. When naming your component you are actually defining its 
goal.

- **Ownership.** Who will own the component?
- **Responsibility.** What is the goal of the component?
- **Kind.** Which kind of a component is that? UI? Node? Backend service? 

Components are identified and named using a unique identifier called ["Component ID"](/components/component-id).

### Create a skeleton component

```bash
bit create blocks/amazing-inventions
```

Alternatively, you can `fork` the component from the demo above in to your project and start from there! 
```bash
bit import learnbit.inventions/blocks/amazing-inventions
```

### Design the API

Think of your component API as a user interface. You are the first user of your component. Design the component to yourself. When desigining a user interface we are always
starting from the user, what he needs? What are his constraints? What is he trying to achieve? Once understanding that API design becomes very easy and intuitive
his requirements? The more consumers there are, the better the API design would be.

Think about the requirements of your consumers, what do they need?

- API first. Think of the API as the user interface of your component.
- 
- Build only the API you need.
- Extendability.


## Implement the component

You can build the component in isolation, or import any component you want to test it againsts! 
Let's say we would like to use this component on Bit docs, adding here to this section here!

### Implement your logic from the ground up

### Use the API

```bash
$ bit import learnbit.inventions/ui/bit-dev
```

### Compose components

```bash
$ bit install @learnbit/inventions.ui.invention-grid
```

:::note
You can configure the package manager of your choice in the `workspace.jsonc` file. Supported package managers
for `bit install` are currently [Yarn 2.0](/) and [pnpm](/).
:::

or alternatively you can fork and build your own, or just create a new component for it.

```bash
$ bit import learnbit.inventions/ui/invention-grid
```

Compose the `invention-grid` component into `amazing-inventions`.

```ts
import { InventionGrid } from '@learnbit/inventions.ui.invention-grid';
```

Now we create create 


## Collaborate
Now that we have done our work and all seems to be working locally, its time to share our changes and collaborate with others.
Bit tells you exacly which components has changed.

```
$ bit status
```

### Create a remote scope
Earlier we have chosen a default Scope for our workspace. We need to either host our own scope, or use Bit Cloud.


### Create a Lane

```
$ bit lane create my-feature
```

### Share the components

```
bit export
```

### Be aware to how changes affect others

### Merge


## Deploy an App

```
bit create react-app 
```
