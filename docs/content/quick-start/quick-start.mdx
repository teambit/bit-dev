# Quick Start

Bit is an extensible, [open-source toolchain](https://github.com/teambit/bit) for building independent components, and composing them into highly performing and consistent [component-driven apps](/understanding-bit/component-driven-software) at speed. Instead of building a monolithic app, with Bit you build Components and compose them into <!-- TODO [Apps](/apps/overview) --> apps, driving [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principles, helping developers build better software while allowing organizations and communities to scale through autonomous teams and cross-team collaboration.

## Installing Bit

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```

Learn more about upgrading Bit to the latest version in our [upgrading guide](/guides/upgrading/).

## Compose Components

Bit is all about creating [Independent Components](/components/overview) and composing them together. Every [Component](/components/overview) is an independent module, promoting modular and SOLID design principles and scalable for collaboration in all team sizes.

### Creating a Workspace

A [Workspace](/workspace/overview) is where you build components and compose them into applications. Creating a [Workspace](/workspace/overview) can be easily with the `bit new` command.
[Workspace Templates](/workspace/workspace-templates). For more Workspace Templates search [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev/templates).

```bash
bit new basic my-workspace
```

```bash
cd my-workspace
```

```bash
bit start
```

### Create Components

[Creating Components](/getting-started/compose-components/create-components) can be done using our pre-defined templates which generates all necessary files for your component including compositions, docs and test files.
Components must be in their own directory and have an index file that exports the component.

The following command will add a new component to your workspace under the [namespace](/components/component-id#sub-categories-with-namespaces) of 'ui'.

```bash
bit create react ui/my-component
```

:::note
Use the `bit templates` command to see a list of available templates.

Learn more about [Creating Components](/getting-started/compose-components/create-components) including how to [create your own templates](/extending-bit/guides/creating-custom-generator).

### Dev environments

Bit helps to simplify and standardize common operations required for developing components like [compiling](/compiler/overview), [testing](/tester/overview), [linting](/linter/overview), [formatting](/formatter/overview) and more.
To learn more about the different services available in Bit go to [Env Services](/envs/core-services).

Compile your components and output in the `node_modules` directory:

```bash
bit compile
```

Test your components:

```bash
bit test
```

Lint your components:

```bash
bit lint
```

Format your components:

```bash
bit format
```

You can use the `--help` flag for each of these commands to learn more.

:::note
Bit automatically watches and re-executes your component's tests when using `bit start`.

## Release Components

Version your components and host them remotely to collaborate with others.

### Version Components

With Bit status, you can see which components have changes and need to be versioned as well as how dependents are affected
from these changes.

```bash
bit status
```

Bit helps version multiple components and dependencies at ease. Version changed components and their dependents
with a single command.

```bash
bit tag --all 1.0.0 --message 'my first version'
```

### Export Components

To export your components you need to create a remote scope. Creating a remote Scope can be done
by [hosting your own](/getting-started/release-components/create-remote-scope/self-host-scope) or creating a Scope on [Bit's cloud provider](https://bit.dev).

```bash
bit export
```

:::note
Before exporting make sure you have set the default scope to be your [remote scope](/scope/setting-remote-scope) in the `workspace.jsonc` file.
:::

## Use and Collaborate on Components

### Install Components

Bit helps you install and resolve packages in your workspace with the Bit install command. It makes sure that every
component in your Workspace is resolved with the right package dependencies and their corresponding versions.

```bash
bit install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

:::note
You can configure the package manager of your choice in the `workspace.jsonc` file. Supported package managers
for `bit install` are currently [Yarn 2.0](/) and [pnpm](/).
:::

Components can be installed with any package manager in any other app, whether it is a Bit Workspace or not.

- NPM: `npm install @some-org.scope/my-component`
- Yarn: `yarn add @some-org.scope/my-component`

Make sure you [configure the Bit registry](/configurations/config-files#npm-config-npmrc) if you are using Bit's cloud provider. Components can be published to any registry or integrated with Artifactory or Nexus.

### Importing Components

Components can be [imported (cloned)](/workspace/importing-components) to any Bit Workspace. By importing components you can make changes to any component
from any Bit Workspace and then export a new version and eject it from your workspace.

```bash
bit import some-org.scope/my-component
```

<!-- ### Change requests

Create a new branch for your component, commit your changes and then export your components to a remote scope.

```bash
bit switch my-feature --create # create and switch to a new branch called my-feature
bit snap --all # commit all changes
bit export # export your components to a remote scope
```
