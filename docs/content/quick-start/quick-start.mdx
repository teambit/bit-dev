## Introduction
This is a simple app, built with Bit.



### What is Bit?
Bit is a toolchain for component-driven software. 

<!-- Every independent component built, compounds in value and becomes an asset
for the developer, the team and the entire organization and can be used for the definition and development of new products.  -->

Bit stands at the intersection between product and engineering. **It helps you take complex product requirements, and break them down into independent, 
and reusable pieces called ["components"](/components) that fit well together**. Components can be anything, independent by nature from a React component, 
Node module, React hook, Microservice, Angular module, serverless function and to anything else you might imagine. Using Bit could also remind you of composing an 
house out of lego bricks, in collaboration with few more people. 

As a developer, imagine having a single repository for each of your components, and a dev experience that makes the development of them seamless together. 
As an arhictect, imagine having your entire software architecture built from service-oriented components, sorted and controlled on a single architectural graph, it is like scaling
Microservices for everything. As a designer, think of composing a design out of layers, each layer is indepednent and reusable. 

Bit does not prescribe how you build your entire application. It helps you define and compose components and allows for every component to adopt the dev tools that best fit its nature. 
A React component might be compiled, tested and sometimes even deployed with a different composition of tools than a Microservice component, or a generic function. 
Bit comes with native support in various dev tools like [TypeScript](/tools/typescript), [Babel](/tools/babel), [Jest](/tools/jest), [Webpack](/tools/webpack), [ESLint](/tools/eslint) and 
ready made development environments for [React](/frameworks/react), [NodeJS](/frameworks/node), [Angular](/envs/angular) and more. New tools can be easily integrated by 
adding one more component into Bit!

### What you can do with Bit?
Anything is possible with Bit! We built [Bit](https://bit.dev) and [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) entirely using Bit, and it is quite complex which includes thousands of
components, built across over 50 Scopes of responsibilities. From component hosting, search, serverless, complex UI and multi environment user interface, two websites and more, 
all using a single graph of components (well just almost, after all we have legacy monolith too!).

People use Bit to create all kind of applications, from user interfaces with component-driven frameworks like React, Vue and Angular, to complex 
micro-service architectures, serverless functions, CLI utlities, desktop applications, native mobile applications and even IoT. You can do with Bit about anything you can do with JS 
and even beyond.

Building in components promotes good software design practices like single resposibility principle, seperation of concerns and encapsulation. It helps drive symmetery between 
product requirements, architecture and the organization structure allowing development to scale to more teams owning specific product responsibilities.

### Bit uses TypeScript and JavaScript
Bit was built with TypeScript and supports it natively. It was designed to be language-agnostic, and can support other software languages in the future! 
For now, our development environments use offcial TypeScript by default, to compile both JS and TS components and you can easily change to use Babel as a compiler or anything else
in your custom environment, Bit has no opinion regarding your tech stack.

### Learning Bit

There are few ways to get started with Bit. 

- If you feel like **quickly learning what Bit is about**, head over to the [Thinking in Components](/thinking-in-components). This tutorial won't get you to understand
all the technical details of Bit, but will get you a good feeling of what it is like building component-driven software with Bit.
- If you are **familiar with Bit and its concepts**, and want to dive deep into a specific topic, head over to the different chapters on the Learn section.

The rest of this page, will guide you step by step through the different concepts of Bit and will help navigate through the docs and decide
which concepts to dive deeper into.

## Installation

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```

Learn more about upgrading and installing Bit on the [BVM (Bit Version Manager) documantation](/bvm/installing-bit).

### Creating a Workspace

A [Workspace](/workspace/overview) is where you build and compose components. Creating a new [Workspace](/workspace/overview) can be done with the `bit new` command.
[Workspace Templates](/workspace/workspace-templates). For more Workspace Templates search [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev/templates).

```bash
bit new basic my-workspace
```

Workspaces can also be on existing projects. Learn about how to [initlize Bit on an existing project here](/).

```bash
cd my-workspace
```

```bash
bit start
```

Learn more about [Workspaces](/workspace/overview).

### Create Components

[Creating Components](/getting-started/compose-components/create-components) can be done using our pre-defined templates which generates all necessary files for your component including compositions, docs and test files.
Components must be in their own directory and have an index file that exports the component.

The following command will add a new component to your workspace under the `ui` [namespace](/components/component-id#sub-categories-with-namespaces).

```bash
bit create react ui/my-component
```

:::note
Use the `bit templates` command to see a list of available templates.
:::

Learn more about [Creating Components](/getting-started/compose-components/create-components) including how to [create your own templates](/extending-bit/guides/creating-custom-generator).


### Use Dependencies
Creating dependencies

### Dev environments

Bit helps to simplify and standardize common operations required for developing components like [compiling](/compiler/overview), [testing](/tester/overview), [linting](/linter/overview), [formatting](/formatter/overview) and more.
To learn more about the different services available in Bit go to [Env Services](/envs/core-services).

Compile your components and output in the `node_modules` directory:

```bash
bit compile
```

Test your components:

```bash
bit test
```

Lint your components:

```bash
bit lint
```

Format your components:

```bash
bit format
```

You can use the `--help` flag for each of these commands to learn more.

:::note
Bit automatically watches and re-executes your component's tests when using `bit start`.
:::

Learn more about [component testing](/tester/overview).

## Collaborate on Components

Version your components and host them remotely to collaborate with others.

### Version Components

With Bit status, you can see which components have changes and need to be versioned as well as how dependents are affected
from these changes.

```bash
bit status
```

Bit helps version multiple components and dependencies at ease. Version changed components and their dependents
with a single command.

```bash
bit tag --all 1.0.0 --message 'my first version'
```

### Share Components

To export your components you need to create a remote scope. Creating a remote Scope can be done
by [hosting your own](/getting-started/release-components/create-remote-scope/self-host-scope) or creating a Scope on [Bit's cloud provider](https://bit.dev).

```bash
bit export
```

:::note
Before exporting make sure you have set the default scope to be your [remote scope](/scope/setting-remote-scope) in the `workspace.jsonc` file.
:::

## Use Components

### Install Components

Bit helps you install and resolve packages in your workspace with the Bit install command. It makes sure that every
component in your Workspace is resolved with the right package dependencies and their corresponding versions.

```bash
bit install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

:::note
You can configure the package manager of your choice in the `workspace.jsonc` file. Supported package managers
for `bit install` are currently [Yarn 2.0](/) and [pnpm](/).
:::

Components can be installed with any package manager in any other app, whether it is a Bit Workspace or not.

```bash
npm install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

Make sure you [configure the Bit registry](/configurations/config-files#npm-config-npmrc) if you are using Bit's cloud provider. Components can be published to any registry or integrated with Artifactory or Nexus.

### Importing Components

Components can be [imported (cloned)](/workspace/importing-components) to any Bit Workspace. By importing components you can make changes to any component
from any Bit Workspace and then export a new version and eject it from your workspace.

```bash
bit import some-org.scope/my-component
```

<!-- ### Change requests

Create a new branch for your component, commit your changes and then export your components to a remote scope.

```bash
bit switch my-feature --create # create and switch to a new branch called my-feature
bit snap --all # commit all changes
bit export # export your components to a remote scope
```
