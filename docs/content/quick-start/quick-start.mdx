# Quick start
Welcome to the Bit documantation! Here is an overview of what you will be able to learn here.

## Introduction
This is a simple app, built with Bit.




### What is Bit?
Bit is a toolchain for component-driven software. It helps you take a complex product requirement, and break them down to independent component-driven architecture. "components" 


### What you can do with Bit?
Almost anything is possible with Bit! We built [Bit](https://bit.dev) and [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) entirely using Bit, and it is quite complex which includes dozens of
microservices, microfrontends  

invovles quite a lot.
From hosting, search, serverless, complex UI and multi environment user interface, two websites and more, all using the same components (well just almost, after all we have legacy too!).

People use Bit to create all kind of applications, from user interfaces with component-driven frameworks like React, Vue and Angular, to complex 
micro-service architectures, serverless functions, CLI utlities, desktop applications, native mobile applications and even IoT. You can do with Bit about anything you can do with JS 
any even beyond.

### Bit uses integrates to everything you use.



## Installing Bit

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```

Learn more about upgrading and installing Bit on the [BVM (Bit Version Manager) documantation](/bvm/installing-bit).

### Creating a Workspace

A [Workspace](/workspace/overview) is where you build and compose components. Creating a new [Workspace](/workspace/overview) can be done with the `bit new` command.
[Workspace Templates](/workspace/workspace-templates). For more Workspace Templates search [Bit.dev](https://bit.dev/templates).

```bash
bit new basic my-workspace
```

Workspaces can also be on existing projects. Learn about how to [initlize Bit on an existing project here](/).

```bash
cd my-workspace
```

```bash
bit start
```

Learn more about [Workspaces](/workspace/overview).

### Create Components

[Creating Components](/getting-started/compose-components/create-components) can be done using our pre-defined templates which generates all necessary files for your component including compositions, docs and test files.
Components must be in their own directory and have an index file that exports the component.

The following command will add a new component to your workspace under the `ui` [namespace](/components/component-id#sub-categories-with-namespaces).

```bash
bit create react ui/my-component
```

:::note
Use the `bit templates` command to see a list of available templates.

Learn more about [Creating Components](/getting-started/compose-components/create-components) including how to [create your own templates](/extending-bit/guides/creating-custom-generator).


### Use Dependencies
Creating dependencies

### Dev environments

Bit helps to simplify and standardize common operations required for developing components like [compiling](/compiler/overview), [testing](/tester/overview), [linting](/linter/overview), [formatting](/formatter/overview) and more.
To learn more about the different services available in Bit go to [Env Services](/envs/core-services).

Compile your components and output in the `node_modules` directory:

```bash
bit compile
```

Test your components:

```bash
bit test
```

Lint your components:

```bash
bit lint
```

Format your components:

```bash
bit format
```

You can use the `--help` flag for each of these commands to learn more.

:::note
Bit automatically watches and re-executes your component's tests when using `bit start`.

Learn more about [component testing](/tester/overview).

## Collaborate on Components

Version your components and host them remotely to collaborate with others.

### Version Components

With Bit status, you can see which components have changes and need to be versioned as well as how dependents are affected
from these changes.

```bash
bit status
```

Bit helps version multiple components and dependencies at ease. Version changed components and their dependents
with a single command.

```bash
bit tag --all 1.0.0 --message 'my first version'
```

### Share Components

To export your components you need to create a remote scope. Creating a remote Scope can be done
by [hosting your own](/getting-started/release-components/create-remote-scope/self-host-scope) or creating a Scope on [Bit's cloud provider](https://bit.dev).

```bash
bit export
```

:::note
Before exporting make sure you have set the default scope to be your [remote scope](/scope/setting-remote-scope) in the `workspace.jsonc` file.
:::

## Use Components

### Install Components

Bit helps you install and resolve packages in your workspace with the Bit install command. It makes sure that every
component in your Workspace is resolved with the right package dependencies and their corresponding versions.

```bash
bit install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

:::note
You can configure the package manager of your choice in the `workspace.jsonc` file. Supported package managers
for `bit install` are currently [Yarn 2.0](/) and [pnpm](/).
:::

Components can be installed with any package manager in any other app, whether it is a Bit Workspace or not.

```bash
npm install @teambit/base-ui.my-component
```

Make sure you [configure the Bit registry](/configurations/config-files#npm-config-npmrc) if you are using Bit's cloud provider. Components can be published to any registry or integrated with Artifactory or Nexus.

### Importing Components

Components can be [imported (cloned)](/workspace/importing-components) to any Bit Workspace. By importing components you can make changes to any component
from any Bit Workspace and then export a new version and eject it from your workspace.

```bash
bit import some-org.scope/my-component
```

<!-- ### Change requests

Create a new branch for your component, commit your changes and then export your components to a remote scope.

```bash
bit switch my-feature --create # create and switch to a new branch called my-feature
bit snap --all # commit all changes
bit export # export your components to a remote scope
```
