## Tone

## Demonstrating commands

## General notes

- Aim to guide the reader to use the documented component as quickly as possible
- Use templates and demo components instead of verbose instructions and long snippets of code
- Think of the documentation as a list of atomic instructions, each aim to introduce a separate value. Order instructions according to ROI.
- Information that is hard to makes sense of before using the demo component, should be included in the template/demo component docs as well as in comments, inside the component's code.
- As a rule of thumb, try to avoid using templates as they often require additional configuration in the `workspace.jsonc` file. Instead, use `bit fork`, to fork a demo component.

## Introduction section

An introduction section always include an explanatation of what, why and how.

- **What** what it is.
- **Why** why it is needed.
- **How** how it works.

For example:

<!-- NEED: change to a simpler example here -->
> The UMD target component demonstrates the bundling of a React component into a `<script>` target.  
> Having the app consumable using a `<script>` tag allows you to integrate it into any other app, regardless of the specific tech used by that app.
> To achieve that, the UMD target component uses a [Webpack transformer](https://bit.dev/teambit/webpack/content/configure-webpack/~compositions) that sets the target output for the bundler to a [UMD library](https://webpack.com/libraries).

<!-- TODO: Move to the `teambit.docs/documenting-components` component -->
<!-- ## Labels

Labels serve two purposes:

- They promote discoverability
- They provide context in a clear and concise manner

The list of labels should include keywords that are likely to be used as search queries by users looking for a component of that type.

The classification of the component in Bit's taxonomy. For example, `env`, `build task`, `app`, `template`, etc.
To prevent the list of labels from becoming too long, try to include only those categories that are placed highest in Bit's taxonomy hierarchy. For example,
a component of type `env` will most probably also register its own build tasks. In this case, labeling it with `build task` is redundant as the reader already expects it to provide build tasks. -->

<!-- - Third party tools used by the component. For example, `Webpack`, `Typescript`, etc.

- Third party providers used by the component. for example, `Netlify`, `Cloudflare`, `Zappier`, etc.

- Frameworks and runtime environments used by the component. For example, `React`, `NodeJS`, `Angular`, `Deno`, etc. -->

# Documentation style guide

 - Focus on the usage
 - P
 

## Links
- Link from Github to Bit.
- Do not avoid linking from a Bit to Github. 

## Titles

Capitalize only the first letter:

- DO: Dependency updates
- DONT: Dependency Updates

## Demonstrating commands

- Be specific

DONT:

```bash
bit compile <component_id>
```

DO:

```bash
bit compile button
```

### Arguments

Mandatory arguments:

```
bit create COMPONENT_TEMPLATE COMPONENT_NAME
```

Arguments that can repeat:

```
bit create COMPONENT_TEMPLATE COMPONENT_NAME...
```

Optional arguments:

```
bit create COMPONENT_TEMPLATE COMPONENT_NAME [--scope SCOPE_NAME]
```

Mutually exclusive arguments:

```bash
bit tag {--all | COMPONENT_ID...}
```

## Output

Run the following command:

```
bit show company.demo/ui/text
```

This will output the following:

```
┌───────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ id                │ company.scope/ui/text@0.0.2                              │
├───────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ scope             │ company.scope                                            │
└───────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Aspects

### Aspect names

Use an uppercase at the beginning of every word.

- _Recommended_: Dependency Resolver
- _Not recommended_: dependency resolver
- _Not recommended_: Dependency resolver

## Links

Always use the description of the link as the link text.

- _Recommended_: Read more about updating dependencies in [Dependency updates](#)
- _Not recommended_: [See here](#) to learn more about updating dependencies

## Components

### Referencing a Component

When referencing a component use its full component ID.

Example:
```
bit show company.demo/ui/text
```
