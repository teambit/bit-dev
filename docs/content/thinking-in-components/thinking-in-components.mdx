# Thinking in components

<Subtitle>
  Component-driven software changes the way you think about software architecture and collaboration. Where once you might have seen a forest, after working with Bit, 
  you will see independent trees and people owning them. Bit makes it simple to build in components, helping you drive better seperation of concerns, shaping every independent component as a
  valuable product for others.

## Components
Components are the core concept and the building block of component-driven software. Components can be anything from a general purpose modules, UI components, frontend applications, 
backend services and even content! You can think of anything in components, even outside the world of software.
Components sometime mean different things to different stakeholders of a modern product team.

As a product manager, using components means building reusable pieces of value which cut down future development time, improve user experience and leads to shipping more value faster.
For a product designer, using components means less time spent arduously repeating the same pattern over and over again in Sketch or Figma files.
For a developer, using components means building reusable, independent pieces of code.

Thinking in components has a lot of benefits.

- **Speed.** There might be a steep curve in the short term, but over the long run, well established components will likely to help speed up development
of future releases. 

- **User experience.** User experience tends to become inconsistent over time and you start facing problems like a settings page with variaty of different drop downs
or buttons that look differently across different product sections. Inconsistent designs and behaviours consfuse users and is the opposite from crafting a 
delightful product experience.

- **Adaptability.** Every component built, is a component you iterate on and improve over time. Using components helps to adapt to product changes and business requirements quickly. 
Every change drives more value. 

Successful component thinking is done in collaboration with others in a top down process. Implementation is bottom up.

## Start with an end
When starting the planning of new components, it is most important to understand **where and how the component would be used**.
The more concerte usages you have for a component, the better it will be! It is good to start using the component sooner than later. Using components earliar in the process
help tackle real-life constraints early on the development process and results in producing better components.

## Collaborate on breaking the product specification to components
A product specification is a blueprint that outlines the product you will be building, what it is going to look like, and specific requirements and behaviours. Usually
a product spec comes in the shape of a design sketch using tools like Figma or Sketch and a set rules defining the product expected behavior.

Start by taking the product spec, together with a designer and a product manager and define the components that play role. Start with the first component you need to use
and slowly propogate to define more components including UI and behaviour as you need them, from the ground up.

Easiest is to start with the UI
components and slowly propogate up the tree to behaviour, and decide on the assets of value, you are creating for your team. 

- **Product.** Bring the product specification and requirements. Shape the product  
- **Engineering.** Your role is to bring up the technical constraints, help shape functionality into components that work in reality. Use the same techniques used
to decide if to create a function or class. Disribute things that get bigger into smaller components.
- **Design.** - Bring the design constraints.
- **Business.** Think of the business responsbility of the component. Drive balanced decision making.

The process of breaking down a product spec to components starts by defining which components are required and searching for existing ones that might fit our requirements. We might need 
to adjust some of our existing components to support new capabilities.

Lets take the example below and start breaking it to component together. Every breakdown starts with the most concerete component. In this case we are building a
Product Card. The first question should be: where would I use the card? If there is no usage for the card it is probably not a good idea to start building it.

Try and define the following:

- Components to use.
- Components to change.
- New components to build.

Not always we get it perfect from the get go but no worries! You can always iterate and change as you evolve your feature.
<!-- TODO: force nav blue highlithing on all components in the below. -->

<ArchitectureBreakdown />

1. Break down the product spec into components.
2. Name each of the components.
3. Search for components that fill these requirements.
4. Use the component, or create a new one if you couldn't find any fit.
5. Distribtue ownership.

:::tip
Breaking down product specification in collaboration with stake-holders like backend developers, designers or product managers, help surface issues early on the development process, 
and helps everyone understand each other and build better products together.

## Balance long term and short term



## Build bottom up
People tend to confuse starting bottoms up. Intuition is to start with a small component like a `Button` and then compose it all the way
up to an application. Actually, it is quite the opposite. You should start with the first component you are going to actually **use**, and build the components you need
to achieve your goal.

```bash
bit create react ui/product-card --scope 
```


### Use as early as possible

### Iterate
