# Thinking in components

As you might have noticed, this site was built in components. As we built the new documentation we started hiring more people to work for our company and we needed
an internal wiki site to be a single source of truth for all information internal at Bit to keep everyone in sync. We decided to document the process to demonstrate
thinking in components.

## Monolithic thinking

Thinking even of this simple product as one piece, keeps us further away from initial value creation. This approach focuses on a single point of value that can only ever serve a single purpose; the bigger the piece gets, the bigger the problem becomes.

Persisting with this pattern of thinking compounds the problem; work is repeated infinitely. As more people join a team and continue this pattern, even more repetition takes place.

This amounts to unnecessary amounts of duplicated code, design sketches and product specs, with slight differences that makes them a lesser whole together. This is an ever growing debt that decreases the pace of value creation and the quality of work produced.

Even worse, repeating work is repeating decisions, reducing productivity, ending up with teams diverging to different paths for similar problems. Diverged decisions pile up to a growing burden that divides teams further apart, where collaboration is discouraged and morale deteriorates.

For a developer, that means building tightly-coupled code that is hard to reuse and limiting .

Value creation is exponentially decaying over time, ending up in silos of stagnation.
For a startup, that means bounding yourself to just a few paths, creating very specific value, limiting a company's ability to pivot or adapt to change.

For an enterprise, that means every dollar spent in value creation is decreasing the value of total dollars invested. The more the enterprise invests, the less value it can create.
This equation applies on the entire range, from the smallest system all the way up to the biggest one.  

<!-- This leads us to a dangerous equation; the more we invest in value creation, the more damage is caused. At this point, it might be better if teams stopped working - for the sake of the company. -->

<!-- As you might have noticed, this site was built in components. As we built the new documentation we started hiring more people to work for our company and we needed

thinking in components.

Thinking in components is a recursive process that starts at defining and the **immediate component we need**. Upon the definition of this component, **think which components you wish you had now**.
Search for these components, try to **use or collaborte on something that exists**, otherwise **repeat the process with a new component that fulfills this exact need**.

<!-- Thinking in components is a different mindset. It is about understanding and capitalizing on smaller, reusable portions of value in the mutual work we do that compose together to
a greater whole.
This could apply on almost anything we create from software development, to content creation, design, product management or even organization structure and anything you might imagine.

To demonstarate thinking in components we would use the following simple product that show a list of top inventions: -->

<!-- Before we will dive into the process of thinking and composing this app. Let's start with a component. -->


## Components

A component is an independent, reusable product that provides an interface for using it. Components should serve a single purpose; you begin by designing its interface to suit your own needs, increasing support for new needs from users as they come.

Components are described by names and APIs, and contain source code implementation. Components come in all shapes and sizes. They can be of different kinds like apps, pages, UI, backend services and even content. You can think of almost anything in components.

In fact, everything you see on this page has been created with components.

Building this simple product, usually starts with a spec built by a product manager, design sketch in a tool like Sketch or Figma from the designer, and engineers
that do the development work. These stake holders build their own "worlds" that include variaty of components, products, symbols, which cases them to misunderstanding the reality
and constraints of each other. Over time the misunderstanding grows and product managers are frustrated with engineers and designers not delivering fast enough. Sides get more defensive.
There are more decsions made than what we can possibly communicate. and delivery gets expodentially slower over time (more code to maintain, more inconsistency). As a result, digital
assets developed has very and limited value, which makes it very hard to react to changes quickly. Reacting to change is slow. Downside is not protected. Upside is limited. Work thrown
to garbage.

Problems all of these stake holders are working in different methods and work on different "realities".


- Bad communication.
- Misunderstanding.
- Doesn't scale.
- Prone to inconsistency.
- Investment of time lost.
- Repeating the same.

<!--

A component has a purpose, defined by its name. For example:

Like any product, components are consumer-centric, and aims at increasing adoption from a target audience. Components are built from the ground up,
driven by pragmatic needs we have. Defining a need as a component, which rises further needs.

It is important to use components as early as possible and keep the development iterative, adding frequent and smaller portions of value.
Needs push us to think what is the role of the problem in our lives, but not just but also the life of others around us. The more
components are built, the easier it is to scale the process to further people.

Thinking in components is a recursive process that starts at defining and the **immediate component we need**. Upon the definition of this component, **think which components you wish you had now**.

<!--
Thinking on bit.dev, the first component to start thinking from is bit-dev. Then, I should think what I need in order to build bit.dev.

1. Think which components you wish you had.
2. Search for these components. Collaborate with others in the process.
3. Use the components you found.
4. Communicate on how to use the components you found to your needs.
5. Create the ones you couldn't find.
6. Be the first user of the components you needed.

<!-- Here is an example to the same sample product above, thought and built in components:

<ArchitectureBreakdown />
<br />

Thinking of this simple product in components, ever shortens path to value creation, and ending by creating five new assets of value for our system,
taking leverage of two existing ones. We ended up creating five new responsibilities in the system we all understand.
The smaller details become an asset instead of a burdon.

Repeating this pattern of thinking, ends up with a positive equation; the more value is created, the easier it gets to create value.

Component naming should be done in collaboration with all stake holders, designer, product manager and designer.

We ended up with creating
something specific, yet flexible. We created a business responsbility for something that we all agree on. We made a decision. We collaborated. Respecting the smaller details.
We created an area of indepedent ownership we can measure and improve. Everyone know about them. They are used already. Asset of value.

Repeating this way of thinking,

Thinking of this in components, is like walking in a path, where you think of see problems in reality, and you are looking at them from the bottom up.

Thinking of this product in components, ends up with a shorter path to value, collaboration, and in the end.

It is about understanding and capitalizing on smaller, reusable portions of value in the mutual work we do that compose together to a greater whole.

<!-- Rules of good component thinking:

- Bottom up.
- Balance short term and long term.

We used this kind of thinking to build Bit and Bit Cloud with about 7 developers. Some people expect so much to be built by dozens of people if not more.
Today Bit is used by dozens of enterprises and tousneds of organization world wide and help a lot of people build software faster!

For a startup, that means building stronger assets to help protect your downside, and increases the pace of value creation over time, which translates to upside.

For an enterprise, being able to sustaine better team collaboration, and eventually better cross team collaboration. that means, and the same is true for the entire range.

<!--
## Think bottom up

## Think composable

## Transparency
Key for successful collaboration between different stakeholders is transparency, components are a language that drive a single source of truth that everyone can understand.
This creates transparency between engineering, product and business people. Once there is transparency, there is collaboration. Product managers can plan for component
use in product specs, and designers can name components the same on Figma.

## Pragmatism
Do the next thing required for you to be successful.

## Build only what you can use
Build only the APIs and comonents you need to accomplish your next goal. If you are finding yourself building an API or a component for the sake of future you, remember that
by the time future you will get there, requirements will most likely to change, and the code will likely to be dead. Implmeneting only the APIs you need shortens times
for delivery, keeps all code alive, and having a component allows to improve and iterate on the component as the requirements grow and change.

## Eat your own dog food
You should ideally use your own components, in case where a component can't be used by you, put yourself in your consumer shoes, and integrate your component to his.

## Rationality

## Components
Components are the core concept and the building block of component-driven software. Components can be anything from a general purpose modules, UI components, frontend applications,
backend services and even content! You can think of anything in components, even outside the world of software.
Components sometime mean different things to different stakeholders of a modern product team.

As a product manager, using components means building reusable pieces of value which cut down future development time, improve user experience and leads to shipping more value faster.
For a product designer, using components means less time spent arduously repeating the same pattern over and over again in Sketch or Figma files.
For a developer, using components means building reusable, independent pieces of code.

Thinking in components has a lot of benefits.

- **Speed.** There might be a steep curve in the short term, but over the long run, well established components will likely to help speed up development
of future releases.

- **User experience.** User experience tends to become inconsistent over time and you start facing problems like a settings page with variaty of different drop downs
or buttons that look differently across different product sections. Inconsistent designs and behaviours consfuse users and is the opposite from crafting a
delightful product experience.

- **Adaptability.** Every component built, is a component you iterate on and improve over time. Using components helps to adapt to product changes and business requirements quickly.
Every change drives more value.

Successful component thinking is done in collaboration with others in a top down process. Implementation is bottom up.

## Start with an end
When starting the planning of new components, it is most important to understand **where and how the component would be used**.
The more concerte usages you have for a component, the better it will be! It is good to start using the component sooner than later. Using components earliar in the process
help tackle real-life constraints early on the development process and results in producing better components.

<TopInventions />


## Collaborate on breaking the product specification to components
A product specification is a blueprint that outlines the product you will be building, what it is going to look like, and specific requirements and behaviours. Usually
a product spec comes in the shape of a design sketch using tools like Figma or Sketch and a set rules defining the product expected behavior.

Start by taking the product spec, together with a designer and a product manager and define the components that play role. Start with the first component you need to use
and slowly propogate to define more components including UI and behaviour as you need them, from the ground up.

- **Product.** Bring the product specification and requirements. Think of every component as a reusable asset of value you can use in your specs.
- **Engineering.** Your role is to bring up the technical constraints, help shape functionality into components that work in reality. Use the same techniques used
to decide if to create a function or class. Disribute things that get bigger into smaller components.
- **Design.** - Bring the design constraints. Think of every component as a symbol or a Figma component.
- **Business.** Think of the business responsbility of the component. Drive balanced decision making.

The process of breaking down a product spec to components starts by defining which components are required and searching for existing ones that might fit our requirements. We might need
to adjust some of our existing components to support new capabilities.

Lets take the example below and start breaking it to component together. Every breakdown starts with the most concerete component. In this case we are building a
Product Card. The first question should be: where would I use the card? If there is no usage for the card it is probably not a good idea to start building it.

Try and define the following:

- Components to use.
- Components to change.
- New components to build.

Not always we get it perfect from the get go but no worries! You can always iterate and change as you evolve your feature. -->
<!-- TODO: force nav blue highlithing on all components in the below. -->

<!-- Where there are components, there is light, where there is a monolith, there is dark.

<ArchitectureBreakdown />

1. Break down the product spec into components.
2. Name each of the components.
3. Search for components that fill these requirements.
4. Use the component, or create a new one if you couldn't find any fit.
5. Distribute ownership.

Breaking down product specification in collaboration with stake-holders like backend developers, designers or product managers, help surface issues early on the development process, 
and helps everyone understand each other and build better products together.

## The misperception of short term


## Implementing the component


## Build bottom up
People tend to confuse starting bottoms up. Intuition is to start with a small component like a `Button` and then compose it all the way
up to an application. Actually, it is quite the opposite. You should start with the first component you are going to actually **use**, and build the components you need
to achieve your goal.

```bash
bit create react ui/product-card --scope 
```


### Use as early as possible

### Iterate


## Thinking is components is gradual -->
