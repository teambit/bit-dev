## Step 1: Define the component you need

So in our case, the definition was very simple, we wanted a Wiki in the new internal website we are building for our company called `.bit`. Our first decision was the decide
the name for the component. No worries! Even if you won't get it right on the get go, you can always fix later! 

Naming the component is defining the component responsbility.

```
bit create react-app apps/wiki
```
```
1 component(s) were created

ranm8.wiki/apps/wiki
    location: wiki/apps/wiki
    env:      teambit.react/react
```

Prior to creating any component it is recommended to see if a component was already created before.

We have now created the first node of the graph.

## Step 2: Think which components you wish you had

Now that we have created the component we need it is time to think which components we wish we had now. 
In our case, we needed a Wiki with a straightfoward header and footer for useful links, so we to build the following components:

- Header block. 
- Wiki section.
- Footer block. (bonus)

We will need to either create each of these components or use existing ones we have.

We will start with the header. 

## Step 3: Use components
Use the components.

```bash
bit install @teambit/design.blocks.header
```


```bash
bit install @teambit/docs.sections.docs
```

## Step 4: Create components
Let's start with the header. 

Repeat the process done here. (Go back to step one.)
