# MDX

<ComponentCardDisplay

/>

The [MDX format](https://mdxjs.com/) is perfect for writing documentation for components, as it joins together the ease-of-use and readability of the Markdown syntax with the great flexibility that's enabled by JSX.

MDX docs use a Bit-specific flavor of MDX that [extends the docs front matter](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx/modules/mdx-compiler) and renders them using [Bit's MDX layout](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx/ui/mdx-layout).

## Documenting components with MDX

MDX is supported by Envs that use [Bit's MDX Webpack loader](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx/modules/mdx-loader) for their component previews.
These include the React Env, Node Env, and many others.

To use MDX for component documentation, create a docs file with the `mdx` or `md` extensions.

For example:

```bash {3} title="A 'card' component documented using MDX"
.
├── card.composition.tsx
├── card.docs.mdx
├── card.module.scss
├── card.spec.tsx
├── card.tsx
└── index.ts
```

## Building MDX components

MDX can be used to create independent content components. That is, content that is not an internal dependency of a component, but a component in and of itself (that can be used by other components as an external dependency).
This is done by setting the MDX component to use the [MDX Env](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx/mdx).

### Create an MDX component

As any other component, MDX components can be created manually or using a pre-configured template.

In the below example, we'll use MDX' component template:

```bash
bit create mdx content/my-mdx-component
```

This will generate the following files:

```bash
.
├── index.ts
├── my-mdx-component.composition.tsx
├── my-mdx-component.docs.mdx
└── my-mdx-component.mdx
```

Please note that the entry file (index) should export the MDX content as default. For example:

```ts title="my-mdx-component/index.ts"
export { default as MyMdxComponent } from './my-mdx-component.mdx';
```

### Set components to use the MDX Env

Use Variants to set the MDX components to use the MDX Env. In the example below, we will use the `content` namespace to select all our content components:

```json title="workspace.jsonc"
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{content/**}": {
      "teambit.mdx/mdx": {}
    },
  }
```

## MDX docs structure and features

### Metadata

Use Bit's `description` and `labels` front matter properties to customize the docs ['abstract'](/dev-services/docs/docs-overview#abstract) and ['labels'](/dev-services/docs/docs-overview#labels).

The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines.

For example:

```mdx
---
description: 'Renders a heading with customizable element prop'
labels: ['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6']
---
```

### Content

The MDX file content is compiled by Bit and exported as the default. There's no need to wrap the [content section](/dev-services/docs/docs-overview#content) in a class or a function.

For example:

```mdx title="heading.docs.mdx"
## Heading

A heading component that renders a different heading element depending on what you pass into it. It also renders a text for the Heading.
```

### Live examples

Add static codeblocks to your docs using the standard markdown syntax:

For example:

````md title="heading.docs.mdx"
import { Heading } from './heading';

```jsx
<Heading element="h2">heading</Heading>
```
````

<Image src={staticCodeblockImg} />

Use Bit's live playground component by adding the `live` attribute to your codeblock.

For example:

````md title="heading.docs.mdx"
import { Heading } from './heading';

```jsx live
<Heading element="h2">
  heading<div>more heading</div>
</Heading>
```
````

<Image src={livePlaygroundImg} />
