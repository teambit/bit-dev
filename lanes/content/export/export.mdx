# Exporting lane

Export a lane and all the snaps it encapsule to collaborate on changes for components. Use the same `export` command as you would for exporting a component:

```sh
bit export
```

The lane, alongside the snaps it holds are then exported to the same remote scope.  
Once exported, on the remote scope you see a new drawer that lists all lanes in the scope.

<Image src={scopeLane} />

By choosing a lane, you see which components have snaps in that lane. You can browse any of the snaps to evaluate the changes.
