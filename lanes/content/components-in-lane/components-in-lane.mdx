# Snapping changes

You can snap component changes into a 

Associate a snap to a lane by first ensuring your workspace is on a lane:

```sh
bit lane switch my-lane
```

Now, any snap you do for any component will be tied to the lane.

```sh
bit create react ui/button                   # create a new component
bit snap ui/button --message "my first snap" # create the snap
```

The new snap for your new component is stored in the lane:

```sh
bit show lane my-lane
```

```sh
showing information for my-lane - (remote lane - my-scope/my-lane)
    components (1)
	  ui/button - 387afb9aaee14de53c1ea74979a254b818eedc80
```

After the snap is created, you can also see all the components (with the changes applied onto them) in the workspace UI. Run `start` and when you browse the lane, you see a grid of components.  
When choosing a component, you browse the snap that the lane contain.

:::info Affected components

When your workspace has several components, and you `snap` a component, all components that depends on that change will be snapped as well and tracked by the lane.  
Essentially making the lane contain not only the change for your component, but the affected ones as well.

## Snap changes across scopes

A lane can hold changes for components without a limitation of where a component is originally located. You can track changes for components from multiple scopes into the same lane. This is like having a virtual branch that includes changes from multiple repositories.
