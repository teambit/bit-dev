# Importing lanes

A component, even when in a lane, has its own history. It means that you can import a single, or a set of components, from a lane and focus your work. No need to import an entire lane to evaluate or submit a small change.  
The changes you apply and snap for the imported components are logged to the lane, for you to export back.

To import components from a lane you need to first switch your workpsace to the remote lane:

```sh
bit lane switch myorg.myscope/my-lane
```

Once your workspace is checked out on a lane, import a single component from a lane, head over to the remote scope, find the lane and component, and copy the `import` action. It should look something like this:

```sh
bit import teambit.design/content/carousel@5b790b7262be00b31a57f4e044562fe371eb6219
```

This way you can import specific components from a lane, work on them, focus your work, and export only relevant items back to the remote scope, in the lane.

## Import an entire lane

Import a lane and all its components with a single action:

```sh
bit lane switch myorg.myscope/my-lane --get-all
```
