# Create lanes

A lane is similar to a component as it's it also managed within a scope. This means that when we create a new lane, we essentially add a new item to our [local scope](/workspace/structure/local-scope). The lane will later get exported, just like any other component, to a remote scope.

Create a new lane with the following command:

```sh
bit lane create my-lane
```

```sh
successfully added and checked out to a new lane my-lane
this lane will be exported to the default-scope my-scope. to change it, please run "bit lane track" command
```

:::info Auto-lane switch

Notice that Bit automatically moves your workpsace to the new lane.

:::

All local lanes are listed in the workspace UI. Run:

```sh
bit start
```

Below the list of components, you see a new drawer with the list of lanes.

By default the new lane is attached to the `defaultScope` as configured in your local `workspace.jsonc`.

You can see the remote scope information for your new lane:

```sh
bit lane show my-lane
```

```sh
showing information for my-lane - (remote lane - my-scope/my-lane)
	components (0)
```

## Remote scope

If you want to set a different target remote scope a new lane use the `--remote-scope` option:

```sh
bit lane create my-lane --remote-scope my-org.some-scope
```

In some cases a lane was already created (or even exported) and you want to move it to another remote scope. To change the remote for a lane, use the `track` sub-command:

```sh
bit lane track my-lane my-org.some-other-scope
```

This way you can move a lane, alongside all the changes encapsulated as part of it, to a new target scope.

## Remote and local lane names

There may be cases where the name of a lane you created is already captured on the remote scope. Bit does not support renaming a lane at the moment, but what you can do is set a "remote name" for your lane.  
A remote name means that a lane may have a different unique name only on the remote scope, while keeping your local lane name.

```sh
bit lane track my-lane my-org.some-other-scope remote-lane-name
```
