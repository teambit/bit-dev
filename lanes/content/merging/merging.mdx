# Merging changes

Merging a lane means taking a snap of a component from a lane, and merge it back to the component.

To merge all snaps in your lane to another, first get all components of a lane, and then use the `merge` sub-command

```sh
bit lane switch myorg.myscope/my-lane --get-all
bit lane merge main
```

This merges all changes for all components in the lane to the main lane. Bit creates a snap for each component, highlighting the merge that has happen.

You can now decide to `tag` a new version.

```sh
bit tag --all --message "new version after merge"
```
