# App build

An app component has an additional build task added to its build pipeline. This build task is set by it's app-type and is responsible for generating the artifacts for deployment.
The entry file for that build, as well as any other available build configuration, is set in the app plugin file (for example, `my-app.react-app.ts`).

To test your app's build without execution of your deployment task, run the following:

```bash
bit build apps/my-app
```

Head over to this Component's capsule to examine the output of its build (get the capsule's path by running `bit capsule list`).
Check your app-type documentation to find the exact build directory used by it.

Note that an app's build configuration is not identical to the configuration set by its env.
For instance, a React app component may have one set of bundle configurations for its component previews and a different one for its deployment.
That means, among other things, that a working composition does not guarantee a working app.
