An app is a deployable Component that is consumable in runtime. That includes full applications, as well as, micro-frontends, microservices and serverless functions. A deployable Component contains all the information it needs for it to be built and deployed.
Just like any other components, app components are **small**, and composing other components to fulfill their needs. 

An application can be of different types. Most basic one is Node, but different components add new [Application Types](/docs/apps/app-types) you can
use for React, Angular apps and more.

## Composable apps

Here is an example to two used in this documentation site:

<ComponentCardDisplay componentIds={['teambit.community/apps/bit-dev', 'teambit.wiki/apps/wiki']} />
