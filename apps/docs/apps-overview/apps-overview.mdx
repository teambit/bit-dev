# Apps overview

An app is a deployable Component that is consumable in runtime. That includes full applications, as well as, micro-frontends, microservices and serverless functions. A deployable Component contains all the information it needs for it to be built and deployed.

Just like any other components, app components are **small**, and composing other components to fulfill their needs.

Here is an example to two used in this documentation site:

<ComponentCardDisplay componentIds={['teambit.community/apps/bit-dev', 'teambit.wiki/apps/wiki']} />
