# App Deployment

An app component has an additional build task added to its tag and snap pipelines. This build task is set by it's app-type and is responsible for deploying its artifacts.
The information for that deployment (authentication, domain, etc.) is set in the app plugin file (for example, `my-app.react-app.ts`).
Note that not all app-types provide their own deployment functions. In these cases, provide your own custom deployer or search Bit.cloud for a compatible one.

To version and deploy your app, run the following:

```bash
bit tag apps/my-app
```

## Customizing the app deployment

A custom app deployer can be used in you own app or in an app that accepts custom deployers (this is determined by the app-type).

An app's deployment task always follows its build.
The information regarding the app's build as well details about the app's capsule (where the artifacts are generated),
is accessible to the deployer, and can be used for the deployment process.

For example:

```ts
import type { DeployFn } from '@teambit/application';
import { sep } from 'path';

export const deployerExample: DeployFn = (context) => {
  const appCapsulePath = context.capsule.path;
  /* a real implementation would focus on the app's build dir */
  const artifactRelativePaths = context.capsule.getAllFilesPaths();

  console.log(
    'upload file:',
    `${appCapsulePath}${sep}${artifactRelativePaths}`
  );
};
```

Run the following to fork the above demo deployer function:

```bash
bit fork learnbit.apps/deployer-example
```

Use that deployer in an app that accepts deployers. For example, the following shows how this deployer is used in a [node demo app](https://bit.dev/learnbit/apps/node-app):

```ts
import { NodeAppOptions } from '@teambit/node';
import { deployerExample } from '@learnbit/apps.deployer-example';

export const HelloWorldApp: NodeAppOptions = {
  name: 'hello-node-app',
  entry: require.resolve('./hello-world.app-root'),
  deploy: deployerExample,
};

export default HelloWorldApp;
```

:::info Compatible deployers
A deployer is most commonly specific to an app-type or a category of app-types.
When using a deployer, make sure that it is compatible with your app-type.
