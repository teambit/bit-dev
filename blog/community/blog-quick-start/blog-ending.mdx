In the [blog.tsx](https://bit.dev/teambit/blog/blog/~code/blog.tsx) file you'll probably notice that
this is quite a minor component. The main thing no notice is that we are returning three kinds of
pages:

- The home page.
- The labels page show posts filtered by labels.
- The author page show posts filtered by the author.

Each of these pages is a simple component that is rendered by the router. Those pages are versioned and released
independently, regardless of the rest of the components. You can learn more about this component's API in
the component's [docs](https://bit.dev/teambit/blog/blog/).
