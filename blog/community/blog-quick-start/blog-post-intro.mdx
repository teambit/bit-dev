Finally, we reached the end of the list. Your first blog post!
This component is of type [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). Like any other Bit component, it is version controlled by Bit and can be edited and shared.

At the moment, you have to lazy load your blog-post component o=in the [contents.tsx](https://bit.dev/teambit/blog/starter/starter-blog/~code/contents.tsx) file, but in the future, we are planning to allow runtime fetching the blog post components directly from your [scope](https://bit.dev/teambit/blog).
