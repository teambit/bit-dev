# Node overview

The built-in [Node Component Development Environment](https://bit.dev/teambit/harmony/node) is a concrete composition of the [Env Aspect](https://bit.dev/teambit/envs/envs). Use it when getting started with Node components with Bit and later as a base for any future customization of your Node-based workflow.

Node environment is composed out of the base [React Environment](https://bit.dev/teambit/react/react) with some specific overrides for dependency management.

## Create node components

Node implements several component templates:

- `node-env` boilerplate for customizing configuration.

Use any of these templates with the `bit create` command:

```sh
bit create node my-component
```

## Default configuration and services

Node, like all over Environments must implement a set of Service Handlers. For each service, Node compose a different tool and config by default.

> Node is a composition of the React environment with some specific modifications. Most of the links here direct to the actual configs in React environment.

## Customize environment

All environments are extendible. You can take any pre-existing environment, and create a component to extend it. That component can then use APIs to:

- Override default configurations.
- Replace composed tools with others (for example - use Babel instead of TypeScript).
- Add new services and capabilities.

### Create an extension

The first step is to create a component that extends Node. Use the `node-env` template from Node env.

```sh
bit create node-env extensions/custom-node
```

Now that you have a basic customized extension to start from, you can go ahead and use it to set a new component with your custom env:

```bash
bit env set my-component extensions/custom-node
```

### Customize configuration

Node implements a set of APIs you can use to merge your preferred configuration with its defaults. These APIs are called **transformers**.
