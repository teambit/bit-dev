# Aspects Overview

<ComponentCardDisplay componentIds={['teambit.harmony/aspect']} style={{ float: 'left', margin: 20 }} />

Bit is built entirely with Bit. This means that even Bit itself is built in a component-driven architecture. It uses [Harmony](https://bit.cloud/teambit/harmony/harmony) which is a 
component-driven plugin system. Harmony most fundemental type is an Aspect, every Aspect is a full-stack feature, capable of extending UI, backend 
and any other defined runtime environment. Every Aspect also acts as a service to all others, and its API can be used from any other aspect.

We use Harmony as a way to scale development of dev experiences. We dogfood our own APIs and make Bit extensible for others.

## Composable
Harmony is a [component-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering) framework for composing extensible applications. 
Bit uses Harmony to compose itself from components. Every Aspect is a component in Bit, implementing a "feature" that provides an API, and every Aspect can depend on other Aspects and 
compose them into a new feature.

## API first
API is the most primitive interface for a Feature. Therefore, every feature built into Bit is API first and the most fundemental interface for interacting with a Bit Aspect is the 
programmatic API. Programmatic APIs can be used to compose CLI commands, UI interfaces, GraphQL APIs and RESTful APIs and more, possibilities are endless. Aspect consumers
can use the API to extend existing features and build new ones on top of them.

Here is an example to a simple Logger aspect, exposing an API for logging messages and persisting them in memory.
```ts
export class MyLoggerAspect {
  private logs = [];

  public log(log: string) {
    this.logs.push(log);
    console.log('log something');
  }

  public listLogs() {
    return this.logs;
  }

  static async provider() {
    return MyLoggerAspect();
  }
}
```

Other aspects can add this aspect as a dependency and use to log messages.

```ts
export class MyOtherAspect {
  static dependencies = [MyLoggerFeature];
  static async provider([logger]: [MyLoggerFeature]) {
    logger.log('my cool log message');
    return new MyOtherAspect();
  }
}
```

## Extensible
Aspects are extensible by design. Every aspect can expose an API for other aspects to use in order to extend it using [Integration Slots](/extending-bit/slots).
Slot allow other Aspects to "register" a new object that can be later used by them.

An example is the Bit CLI aspects, which other aspects use to add commands. CLI aspect exposes an API for registering new commands, `cli.registerCommand()` which
allows other Aspects to register a new command to Bit.

```ts
import { CLIAspect, CLIMain } from '@teambit/cli';

export class MyOtherAspect {
  static dependencies = [CLIAspect];
  static async provider([cli]: [CLIMain]) {
    cli.registerCommand(new MyCommand());
    return new MyOtherAspect();
  }
}
```

This allows every aspect to extend the CLI aspect by registering a new command to it. Learn more about [Slots](/extending-bit/slots).

## Discoverable
As mentioned, Bit is built entirely from Aspects and other has been developed by the Bit community, therefore they can be discovered
and used in bit.cloud like any other component.

<ComponentCardDisplay componentIds={[
  'teambit.typescript/typescript',
  'teambit.angular/angular',
  'teambit.mdx/mdx',
  'teambit.explorer/command-bar',
  'teambit.pipelines/builder',
  'teambit.defender/tester',
]} />

Aspects can be searched and found across [bit.cloud](https://bit.dev/components?env=aspect).

## Dogfooding
Dogfooding is a core princple of component-driven design, and dev tools development in general. It leans on the philosophy that in order to achieve dev expereinces other can enjoy,
you must be able to enjoy this yourself.
API and feature dogfooding is the key towards generating great dev experiences. Since every Aspect is using itself first, composing its API to various user interfaces, it is
been dogfooded by its maintainer. 

## Multi-runtime
Aspects can declare and extend different runtime environments. An example could be a Logger Aspect which provides an API, but also extends the UI runtime, adding a logger UI
and providing various CLI commands to interact with logs.

Learn more about [Runtimes](/extending-bit/runtimes).

## Configurable
Every Aspect be declare a configuration it accepts, and use it for various needs. This allows Aspects to be configured with different configuration on the composition level.

```json
{
  "my-org.scope/logger": {
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```
