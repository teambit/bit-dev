# Using Aspects

Aspects can be used to extend Bit with simple configurations, to both the Scope and the Workspace. Aspects can also be composed into Harmony applications.

## Configuring Aspects

```json
{
  "myorg.dev/my-aspect": {}
}
```

## Composing Aspects into Applications

```tsx
import { Harmony } from '@teambit/harmony';
import { MyAspect } from '@myorg/dev.my-aspect';

Harmony.run([MyAspect]);
```
