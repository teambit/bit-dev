# Using Aspects

Aspects can be used to extend Bit by configuring them on your Workspace, Scope and Components. You can also use Aspects from other Aspects you
build and use them as an API.

You can use official and community Aspects built by us and the Bit community like the ones below or [build your own Aspect](/extending-bit/create-aspect).

<ComponentCardDisplay componentIds={[
  'teambit.typescript/typescript',
  'teambit.angular/angular',
  'teambit.mdx/mdx',
]} />

<br />

You can find more [available aspects to use here](/extending-bit/aspect-overview#discoverable) and on the [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud/components?env=aspect) search!

## Using Aspects

Aspects can be configured across any [Bit config](/). That means, you can use aspects to extend the functionality of Scopes, Workspaces,
Components or any other feature built in an Aspect.

```json
{
  "myorg.dev/my-aspect": {}
}
```

## Listing aspects

List all components and the aspects they have configured.

```
bit aspect list
```

## Inspecting aspects

Inspect a specific component` aspects, including metadata and config.

```
bit aspect get docs/apps-overview
```


## Updating aspects

Update components to a newer aspect version.

Update all components using the community-react aspect.

```bash
bit aspect update teambit.community/envs/community-react
```

Update components using the community-env aspect under the ui/* namespace.

```bash
bit aspect update teambit.community/envs/community-react "ui/*"
```

## As an Aspect dependency

Aspects can be used as dependencies by other aspects. See [Using dependencies](/extending-bit/creating-aspects#using-dependencies).

## Composing aspects into applications

Behind the scenes, Aspects apps are executed with Harmony, Bit's micro-kernel which powers its extensibility.

Running Aspects with harmony:

```tsx
import { Harmony } from '@teambit/harmony';
import { MyAspect } from '@myorg/dev.my-aspect';

Harmony.run([MyAspect]);
```
