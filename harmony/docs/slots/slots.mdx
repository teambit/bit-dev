# Slots

Slots is a system for extensibility. They are making it easy for Aspects to pluggable by other Aspects.

Technically, it is a simple registry for objects. It can be used to expose APIs that allow for other Aspects to extend a certain component.
We use slots to allow for API consumers to inject logic and behaviour. For example, behind the scenes, the CLI's aspect 
`registerCommand` API, it just registering the command object to a Slot. Later on, it reads it when computing commands for Bit during
bootstrap. 

Simpler examples for Slots can be found across our UI, which allows you to register to the TopBar of the Component in the Workspace UI
and allows the Scope UI to be extended with a new Drawer.


## Using slots

Slots are used through other Aspect API which expose them, usually through API method with the `register` prefix.
For example, in the example below, we use CLI register method to inject a new command to Bit.

Most aspects across Bit expose slots in their APIs. Slots are available for UIs, Commands, server APIs and more and as a consumer
it is just an implementation detail.

## Exposing slots

Slots are really used by the API maintainer using it. Slots are created and injected by Harmony to aspect providers as seen
in the example below.

This examples shows a simple slot for a Console function. This allows our aspect to expose a `registerConsole` API for others to hook
and replace implementation.  


```ts
import { Slot, SlotRegistry } from '@teambit/harmony';

export type ConsoleFn = (log: string) => void;
export type ConsoleSlot = SlotRegistry<ConsoleFn>;

export class HelloWorldMain {
  constructor(
    private config: HelloWorldConfig,
    private consoleSlot: ConsoleSlot
  ) {}

  // an API for registering new type of consoles. 
  registerConsole(fn: ConsoleFn) {
    this.consoleSlot.register(fn);
    return this;
  }

  // method for saying hello now also invokes a console.
  sayHello() {
    // obtain the console instance from the slot container.
    const consoleFn = this.consoleSlot.get(this.config.consoleId);
    const str = `hello ${this.config.worldName}!`;

    // invoke the slot.
    if (consoleFn) consoleFn(str);
    return str;
  }

  static dependencies = [CLIAspect];

  static defaultConfig = {
    consoleId: 'teambit.logger/file-console'
  };
  
  static slots = Slot.withType<ConsoleSlot>();
  static async provider([cli]: [CLIMain], config: HelloWorldConfig, [consoleSlot]: [ConsoleSlot]) {
    cli.register([new MyCommand()]);
    return new HelloWorldMain(config, consoleSlot);
  }
}
```

Slots objects include an API for listing registered items, obtaining them and more.

### Obtaining an instance

Slots are indexing objects by their corresponding [Component ID](/components/component-id) and provide an API
for accessing the objects it contains.

Invoking `slot.get()` would try and retrieve the instance registered by the correspoding aspect. 

```ts
const instance = consoleSlot.get('my-org.scope/my-aspect'); 
console.log(instance); // retrieves an instance registered to the slot by 'my-org.scope/my-aspect' if any.
```

### Registering a new instance

Registering a new instance to the slot is done using the `slot.register()` API. 

```ts
consoleSlot.register((log) => console.log(log)); 
console.log(consoleSlot.values()); // retrieves a list of all values. In this case: Function[].
```

### Listing all registered instances

Registering a new instance to the slot is done using the `slot.register()` API. 

```ts
const instances = consoleSlot.values();
console.log(instances); // retrieves a list of all values. In this case: Function[].
```

### Listing all registered instances with their keys

Listing instances in a slot with their keys is done using the `slot.toArray()` API. 

```ts
const instances = consoleSlot.toArray();
console.log(instances); // retrieves list of a key-value pair instances. { 'my-org.scope/my-aspect': Function }
```
