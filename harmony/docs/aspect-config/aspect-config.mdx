# Aspect Config

Aspect can be configured anywhere that accepts Harmony configuration. In Bit, it could be the Workspace, Scope or a Component. It might even come up while creating an Harmony application and configuring aspects to it.

## Configuring an Aspect

Configuring either Bit's core aspects or external aspect is just the same.
The example configuration is a basic one used in `workspace.json` to configure the Workspace aspect.
This is how we allow people to configure different variables for the Workspace like its `name` or `defaultScope`.

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my workspace",
    "defaultScope": "teambit.docs"
  }
}
```

External aspects that are configured in a Bit configuration would be automatically and lazily downloaded as needed.

Aspects can also be configured to components using the `aspect` command.

For example:

```bash
bit aspect set my-component my-org.scope/my-dev-env
```

## Defining and accessing an Aspect config

In the example below, we are exposing a way to configure the world name printed by the hello-world aspect.

```ts
// define the type for your aspect config.
export type HelloWorldConfig = {
  worldName: string
};

export class HelloWorldMain {
  constructor(
    private config: HelloWorldConfig
  ) {}

  sayHello() {
    return `hello ${this.config.worldName}!`;
  }

  static dependencies = [CLIAspect];

  // set the default config to be 'world'
  static defaultConfig = {
    worldName: 'world'
  };
  
  static runtime = MainRuntime;
  // config is injected to your provider during construction.
  static async provider([cli]: [CLIMain], config: HelloWorldConfig) {
    cli.register([new MyCommand()]);
    return new HelloWorldMain(config);
  }
}
```

## Default config
In cases where a property was not configured by the aspect consumer, the property would be `undefined` or equal 
to the value defined in the static `defaultConfig` property as shown in the example above.
