# Publishing to CommonJS Registries

Component packages are included in the component versions ([snaps](/docs/components/snaps) and [tags](/docs/components/tags)).
Components hosted on Bit Cloud will have their packages available to be installed by Bit, as well as by standard package managers like npm and Yarn.

However, if you're using self-hosted scopes, packages will not be available for installation \

You can install packages hosted on Bit Cloud, in non-Bit projects, by [configuring your `npmrc` to use Bit Cloud](/docs/packages/npmrc).

Packages can also be published to commonJS package registries like npm. Components that are configured to be published to a commonJS package registry, will be published during their tag process.

```
bit tag ui/heading
```

```
...
new components
(first version for components)
     > ui/heading@0.0.1


published the following 1 component(s) successfully
@my-npm-scope/ui.heading@0.0.1
```

Use [`bit publish`](/docs/reference/cli-reference#publish) to manually publish components from the workspace (not recommended!):

```bash
bit publish ui/heading
```

## Publish your Components to npm

Configure your components to use a different package name by setting the `name` property with a new name.
This will set them to be published to the npm's registry (no need to configure the `publishConfig` property, as well).

You can use the `{name}` and `{scope}` placeholders to inject each component's [full name](/docs/components/component-id#component-full-name), and [scope name](<(/docs/components/component-id#component-full-name)>), to the corresponding package name.
The package name should be prefixed with the [npm scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scope) (see the example below).

To make your packages public, configure the `private` and `packageManagerPublishArgs` properties, accordingly (see the example below).

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "*": {
      "teambit.pkg/pkg": {
        // "packageManagerPublishArgs": ["--access public"],
        "packageJson": {
          //   "private": false,
          "name": "@my-npm-scope/{name}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip make sure you're logged in to npm

```bash
npm login
```

## Publish your Components to any commonJS package registry

Set the `registry` property to your registry's URL. Set the `scope` value to the specific scope in the registry.

To make your packages public, configure the `private` and `packageManagerPublishArgs` properties, accordingly (see the example below).

```json {11-14} title=workspace.jsonc
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "*": {
      "teambit.pkg/pkg": {
        // "packageManagerPublishArgs": [
        //   "--access public"
        // ],
        "packageJson": {
          "name": "@my-scope/{name}",
        //   "private": false,
          "publishConfig": {
            "scope": "@my-scope",
            "registry": "https://registry.something.org/"
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
```
