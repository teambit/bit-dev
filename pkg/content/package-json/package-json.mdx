# package.json

Bit's [Pkg](/packages/packages-overview) Aspect automates the management of the components' [package.json](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-the-file-package-json/) files.

A package file is generated by the [Pkg](/packages/packages-overview) aspect in [Component Capsules](/components/structure/component-capsules) and [Workspace Component Links](/workspace/workspace-component-links), and included in the [generated package](/packages/packing-components) for each [Component](/components/component-overview).

An example of a generated `package.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "@my-org/people.ui.avatar",
  "version": "1.0.4",
  "homepage": "https://bit.dev/my-org/people/ui/avatar",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "componentId": {
    "scope": "my-org.people",
    "name": "ui/avatar",
    "version": "1.0.4"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "...": "^3.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "...": "12.20.4"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "...": "12.0.0"
  },
  "license": "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE"
}
```

## Name

The [package name](/packages/package-name) corresponds to the component's ['component ID'](/components/structure/component-id):

```
my-org.people/ui/avatar --> @my-org/people.ui.avatar
```

Package names [can be modified](/packages/package-name) to a different pattern (that corresponds differently to their component IDs), or set to concrete values.

## Version

The package version is determined by the [tag](/components/tags) release version (whether it is set manually or automatically, by Bit).

```bash
bit tag ui/avatar --ver 2.0.0
```

```json
{
  "name": "@my-org/people.ui.avatar",
  "version": "2.0.0"
  // ...
}
```

## Main file

`mainFile` property in the [package.json](/packages/package-json) is automated from the Component defined [Main File](/components/structure/component-main-file).

To learn more on how to set and control [Component Main File here](/components/structure/component-main-file).

## Dependencies

All dependency related properties are automated and handled by Bit the [Dependency Resolver](/dependencies/overview) Aspect.

Component dependencies are detected and resolved from the [node_modules](/dependencies/node-modules) directory.

### Tracking a component with a main file

```bash
bit add path/to/button --main button.ts
```

## The `componentId` property

The `componentId` property is used by Bit to associate packages in the [node_modules](/dependencies/node-modules) directories to Bit [Components](/components/component-overview). Packages that do not include this property would be considered by Bit as a generic package and won't be recognized as a Bit Component.
