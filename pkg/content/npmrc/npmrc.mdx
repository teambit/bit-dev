# Configuring Bit Cloud in your NPM config

[npmrc's](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/npmrc) are npm config files (used by other package manager as well).

`npmrc` can be configured [per project](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/npmrc#per-project-config-file), [per user](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/npmrc#per-user-config-file), or [globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/npmrc#global-config-file).

Use it to configure your [scope owner name](/docs/components/component-id#owner) on Bit Cloud as a [scoped registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scope). That will enable you to install your components using npm or Yarn.

### Set a scoped registry using npm CLI

```shell
npm config set '@owner:registry' https://node.bit.dev
```

### Set a scoped registry manually

To set it manually choose the `.npmrc` file to modify:

- per-project config file `/path/to/my/project/.npmrc`
- per-user config file `~/.npmrc`
- global config file `$PREFIX/etc/npmrc`
- npm builtin config file `/path/to/npm/npmrc`

```bash
@<owner>:registry=https://node.bit.dev
@teambit:registry=https://node.bit.dev
//node.bit.dev/:_authToken=${BIT_TOKEN}
always-auth=true
```

When running `bit login` the `.npmrc` file is updated with the `_authToken`. However, there could be cases where a `bit login` is not executed (for example, on a remote CI).
In these cases, you can set the `_authToken` value manually. Get the Bit token from a logged-in machine, by running `bit config get user.token`.

`@teambit` should also be configured to get access to Bit dependencies.
