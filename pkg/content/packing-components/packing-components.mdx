# Packing Components

Component packages are generated during execution of the Component [Build Pipelines](build-tasks) and persisted as [Artifacts](/docs/dev-services/builder/build-artifacts) on the Component version.

[Tagging](/docs/components/tags) or [snapping](/docs/components/snaps) a component will result in a newly generated package for the Component.

```bash
$ bit tag ui/heading

...
âœ” env "company.scope/envs/my-react@0.0.1", task "teambit.pkg/pkg:PackComponents" has completed successfully in 1s
```

The generated artifact can be viewed with the `bit artifacts` command.

```
$ bit artifacts ui/heading --task PackComponents

my-workspace/ui/heading@0.0.1
  teambit.pkg/pkg
    PackComponents
      package-tar/company-scope.ui.heading-0.0.1.tgz
```

Generating a component package for any purpose is as simple as using the `bit pack` command in the Workspace.

Component packages can be manually generated, for any purpose, using [`bit pack`](/docs/reference/cli-reference#pack)

```shell
bit pack ui/heading
```
