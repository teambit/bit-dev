# Packing Components

Component packages are generated during execution of the Component [build pipeline](/dev-services-overview/builder/implement-build-task) and persisted as [Artifacts](/dev-services-overview/builder/build-artifacts)
upon component versioning.
[Tagging](/components/tags) or [snapping](/components/snaps) a component will result in a newly generated package for the Component.
To simulate packages prior to tag or snap, use `bit build` and inspect [capsules](/components/component-capsules).

```bash
$ bit tag ui/heading

...
âœ” env "company.scope/envs/my-react@0.0.1", task "teambit.pkg/pkg:PackComponents" has completed successfully in 1s
```

The generated artifact can be viewed with the `bit artifacts` command.

```
$ bit artifacts ui/heading --task PackComponents

my-workspace/ui/heading@0.0.1
  teambit.pkg/pkg
    PackComponents
      package-tar/company-scope.ui.heading-0.0.1.tgz
```

## Generate packages

Component packages can be manually generated, for any purpose, using [`bit pack`](/reference/cli-reference#pack)

```bash
bit pack ui/heading
```

## Excluding sources from packages

To exclude sources from being included in the package, set the `files` property either from the development env or with component configuration.

```json
{
  "teambit.pkg/pkg": {
    "packageJsonProps": {
      "files": ["dist"]
    }
  }
}
```
