Bit does not prescribe how you build your entire application. It helps you define and compose components and allows for every component to adopt the dev tools that best fit its nature.
A React component might be compiled, tested and sometimes even deployed with a different composition of tools than a backend-service component, or a generic function.
Bit comes with native support in various dev tools like TypeScript, Babel, Jest, Webpack, ESLint, and ready made development environments for React, NodeJS, Angular and more. New tools can be easily integrated by adding one more component into Bit!
