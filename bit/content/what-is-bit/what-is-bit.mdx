### What is Bit?

### What can you do with Bit?

Anything is possible with Bit! We built [Bit](https://bit.dev) and [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) entirely using Bit, and it is quite complex which includes thousands of
components, distributed across over 50 Scopes of responsibilities. Including component hosting, search, discovery, dev tools like compilers and testers, in complex UIs.
all using a single graph of components (well just almost, after all we have legacy monolith too!).

People use Bit to create all kind of applications, from user interfaces with component-driven frameworks like React, Vue and Angular, to complex
micro-service architectures, serverless functions, CLI utlities, desktop applications, native mobile applications and even IoT. You can do with Bit about anything you can do with JS
and even beyond.

Building in components promotes good software design practices like single resposibility principle, seperation of concerns and encapsulation. It helps drive symmetery between
product requirements, architecture and the organization structure allowing development to scale to more teams owning specific product responsibilities.

### Bit uses TypeScript and JavaScript

Bit was built with TypeScript and supports it natively. It was designed to be language-agnostic, and can support other software languages in the future!
For now, our development environments use offcial TypeScript by default, to compile both JS and TS components and you can easily change to use Babel as a compiler or anything else
in your custom environment, Bit has no opinion regarding your tech stack.
