### What can you do with Bit?

Anything is possible with Bit! We built [Bit](https://bit.dev) and [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) entirely using Bit. These are complex system which include infrastructure
tools, cloud products and multiple user interfaces.

People use Bit to create all kind of applications, from user interfaces with component-driven frameworks like React, Vue and Angular, to complex
micro-service architectures, serverless functions, CLI utlities, desktop applications, native mobile applications and even IoT. You can do with Bit about anything you can do with JS
and even beyond.

### What Bit supports?

Bit was built with TypeScript and supports it natively. It was designed to be language-agnostic, and can support other software languages in the future!
For now, our development environments use offcial TypeScript by default, to compile both JS and TS components and you can easily change to use Babel as a compiler or anything else, Bit has no opinion regarding your tech stack.
