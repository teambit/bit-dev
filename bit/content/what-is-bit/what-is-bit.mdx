### What is Bit?

Bit is a toolchain for component-driven software. 

<!-- Every independent component built, compounds in value and becomes an asset
for the developer, the team and the entire organization and can be used for the definition and development of new products.  -->

Bit stands at the intersection between product and engineering. **It helps you take complex product requirements, and break them down into independent, versioned,
and reusable pieces called ["components"](/components) that fit well together**. Components can be anything independent by nature from a general purpose module, UI components,
UI applications, pages, blocks, backend services, content and to anything else you might imagine. Using Bit could also remind you of composing a house out of lego bricks, 
in collaboration with few more people.

**As a developer, imagine having a single mini-repository for each of your components, and a dev experience that makes the development of them seamless together.**
As an arhictect, imagine having your entire software architecture built from service-oriented components, sorted and controlled on a single architectural graph, it is like scaling
Microservices for everything. As a designer, think of composing a design out of symbols, each symbol is indepednent and reusable.

Bit does not prescribe how you build your entire application. It helps you define and compose components and allows for every component to adopt the dev tools that best fit its nature.
A React component might be compiled, tested and sometimes even deployed with a different composition of tools than a Microservice component, or a generic function.
Bit comes with native support in various dev tools like [TypeScript](/tools/typescript), [Babel](/tools/babel), [Jest](/tools/jest), [Webpack](/tools/webpack), [ESLint](/tools/eslint) and
ready made development environments for [React](/frameworks/react), [NodeJS](/frameworks/node), [Angular](/envs/angular) and more. New tools can be easily integrated by
adding one more component into Bit!

### What can you do with Bit?

Anything is possible with Bit! We built [Bit](https://bit.dev) and [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) entirely using Bit, and it is quite complex which includes thousands of
components, distributed across over 50 Scopes of responsibilities. Including component hosting, search, discovery, dev tools like compilers and testers, in complex UIs.
all using a single graph of components (well just almost, after all we have legacy monolith too!).

People use Bit to create all kind of applications, from user interfaces with component-driven frameworks like React, Vue and Angular, to complex
micro-service architectures, serverless functions, CLI utlities, desktop applications, native mobile applications and even IoT. You can do with Bit about anything you can do with JS
and even beyond.

Building in components promotes good software design practices like single resposibility principle, seperation of concerns and encapsulation. It helps drive symmetery between
product requirements, architecture and the organization structure allowing development to scale to more teams owning specific product responsibilities.

### Bit uses TypeScript and JavaScript

Bit was built with TypeScript and supports it natively. It was designed to be language-agnostic, and can support other software languages in the future!
For now, our development environments use offcial TypeScript by default, to compile both JS and TS components and you can easily change to use Babel as a compiler or anything else
in your custom environment, Bit has no opinion regarding your tech stack.
