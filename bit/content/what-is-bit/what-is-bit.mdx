### What is Bit?

<WhatIsBitShort />

### What can you do with Bit?

Anything is possible with Bit! We built [Bit](https://bit.dev) and [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) entirely using Bit. These are complex systems which includes infrastructure
tools, cloud products and multiple user interfaces.

People use Bit to create all kind of applications, from user interfaces with component-driven frameworks like React, Vue and Angular, to complex
micro-service architectures, serverless functions, CLI utilities, desktop applications, native mobile applications and even IoT. You can do with Bit about anything you can do with JS
and even beyond.

### What Bit supports?

Bit was built with TypeScript and supports it natively. It was designed to be language-agnostic, and will support other software languages in the future! For now, our development environments use TypeScript as the default compiler for JS and TS components. You can easily switch to Babel or any other compiler. Bit is agnostic to your tech stack.ß
