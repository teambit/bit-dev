Bit stands at the intersection between product and engineering. **It helps you take complex product requirements, and break them down into independent, 
and reusable pieces called ["components"](/components) that fit well together**. Components are described by names and APIs, and contain source code implementation. 
They can be of different kinds like apps, pages, UI components, backend services and even content. You can [think of almost anything in components](/thinking-in-components).

People tend to think of components like apps as "bigger" and components like a button as "smaller", but for us they are just in the same size. Both Button and App are 
small components, with different responsibilities. An App is the most "concrete" component with a large depenendecy graph, and button is the most "abstract" component with just few 
dependencies and a lot of dependents, indecating higher reusability. They have different size but they are equal in size and importance.
