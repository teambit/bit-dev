## Collaborate

Now that we have done our work and all seems to be working locally, its time to share our changes and collaborate with others.  
Bit tells you which components changed and their current [status](/workspace/workspace-status).

```
bit status
```

### Create a remote scope

A [Scope](/scope/scope-overview) is a collaboration server for components. Creating and exporting components to remote scopes enables collaboration with others and is used as a 
remote storage for your components. Other developers with access to your scope, could either use your components or propose changes to them.

Scopes help organize components in a shared area of responsbility. For example, the `analytics` scope will include all components for providing Analytics services, and `design` scope will
include the services for our design language. 

<!-- 
Scopes can be created for every responsibility, for example: `wiki` or `design`

On a deeper level, scopes are used to define responsibility over components in the same sense microservices are used to define ownership and boundaries over software services.
On a deeper level, scopes are used to define responsibility since all  -->

<!-- Scopes define ownership on components, as a single team owns the components exported to a scope.
You can host multiple types of components in a scope, from "small" components all the way to frontend apps or microservices.
Earlier we have chosen a default Scope for our workspace. We need to either host our own scope, or use [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud).  -->

<!-- TODO: @ella Add relavent scope cards here -->

If you don't have a remote scope yet, it is a good time to create one! You can create and host scopes on [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) for free
or [self-host your scope](/scope/running-a-scope-server).

<CreateAccount className={centerColumn} />

If you've created a new remote scope, to update it to be your default scope, use this command:

```
bit scope rename <old-name> <new-name> --refactor
```

The --refactor flag updates the components in your workspace with the new scope name, if you prefer to update manually, remove it:

```
bit scope rename <old-name> <new-name>
```

### Snap your changes

To record your component changes you can use:

```
bit snap --all --message "initial snap"
```

To release components in a new semantic version, use:

```
bit tag --all --message "initial tag"
```

### Create a Lane (Alpha)

Lanes are used to propose component changes to the component main history lane.
To record changes on a Lane.

```bash
bit lane create my-feature
```

Then, use `snap` to record your changes into the Lane:

```bash
bit snap --all --message "my first lane snap"
```

### Export changes to remote scopes

After recoding component changes with snaps or tags, you can sync the staging changes with the defined remote scopes.

```
bit export
```

### Be aware to how changes affect others

Bit automaticlly detects affected dependents in your Workspace. It is a best practice import few or more dependents and test
your changes against them prior to releasing.

```
bit import blocks/header --dependents
```

Running `test` and `build` can test your modified components vs affected dependenies.

```
bit test
```

## Have an idea for your own Quick Start?

If you think you can build a better quick start, or just show anything else. Head over to the
[Quick start for creating Quick Starts](https://bit.cloud/teambit/bit/quick-start), share your own and let us know about it!
