## Collaborate

Now that we have done our work and all seems to be working locally, its time to share our changes and collaborate with others.  
Bit tells you which components changed and their current [status](/workspace/workspace-status).

```
$ bit status
```

### Create a remote scope

Earlier we have chosen a default Scope for our workspace. We need to either host our own scope, or use Bit Cloud.

If you don't have a remote scope yet, it is a good time to create one! You can create and host scopes on [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) for free
or [self-host your scope](/scope/running-a-scope-server).

### Snap your changes
To record your component changes you can use:
```
bit snap --all --message 'initial snap'
```

To release components in a new semantic version, use:

```
bit tag --all --message 'initial tag'
```

### Create a Lane (Alpha)
Lanes are used to propose component changes to the component main history lane. 
To record changes on a Lane. 

```bash
bit lane create my-feature
```

Then, use `snap` to record your changes into the Lane:

```bash 
bit snap --all --message 'my first lane snap'
```

### Export changes to remote scopes
After recoding component changes with snaps or tags, you can sync the staging changes with the defined remote scopes.

```
bit export
```

### Be aware to how changes affect others

Bit automaticlly detects affected dependents in your Workspace. It is a best practice import few or more dependents and test
your changes against them prior to releasing.

```
bit import blocks/header --dependents
```

Running `test` and `build` can test your modified components vs affected dependenies. 
```
bit test
```

## Have an idea for your own Quick Start?

If you think you can build a better quick start, or just show anything else. Head over to the 
[Quick start for creating Quick Starts](/quick-start/quick-start), share your own and let us know about it!
