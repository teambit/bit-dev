## Collaborate

Now that we have done our work and all seems to be working locally, its time to share our changes and collaborate with others.  
Bit tells you exacly which components has changed.

```
$ bit status
```

### Create a remote scope

Earlier we have chosen a default Scope for our workspace. We need to either host our own scope, or use Bit Cloud.

If you don't have a remote scope yet, it is a good time to create one! You can create and host scopes on [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) for free
or [self-host your scope](/docs/scope/running-a-scope-server).

### Snap your changes

### Create a Lane

```
$ bit lane create my-feature
```

### Export changes to a remote scope

```
bit export
```

### Be aware to how changes affect others

### Merge
