Welcome to the Bit documentation site! This site is a composition of independent components, built and maintained mainly by the [Docs](https://bit.dev/teambit/docs),
[Design](https://bit.dev/teambit/design) and [Community](https://bit.dev/teambit/community) teams here at Bit! It was built from React, Markdown, and
Node components we have crafted specifically for the purpose and needs of this app.

## Introduction

During this quick start, you will learn to create your own **composable app**. We will show you how simple it is to build a complex app like a blog made from components!
We will use the components built for this documentation app in this example.
