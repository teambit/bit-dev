Welcome to the Bit documantation site! This site is a composition of independent components, built and maintained mostly by the [Docs](https://bit.dev/teambit/docs),
[Design](https://bit.dev/teambit/design) and [Community](https://bit.dev/teambit/community) teams here at Bit! It is built from React, Markdown and
Node components we have crafted specifically for the purpose and needs of this app.

## Introduction

During this quick start, you will learn to create your own **composable app**. We will show you how simple it is, to build even a complex app like a wiki when built from components!
In this example, we will use the components built for this documantation app.
