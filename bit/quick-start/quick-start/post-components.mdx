Choosing the first component is an important step in the process in building a component-driven design. When choosing the first comopnent, focus on choosing the most
tengible component, the one you can ideally use now. When building a component someone else is expected to use, try and agree on a clear API contract early on to minimize
the amount of uncertainty. Using components as a consumer early on the development process helps avoid uncertainty and achieve faster and more accurate results.
