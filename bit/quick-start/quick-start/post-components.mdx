<!-- Choosing the first component is an important step in the process in building a component-driven design. When choosing the first component, focus on choosing the most
tangible component, the one you can ideally use now. When building a component someone else is expected to use, try and agree on a clear API contract early on to minimize
the amount of uncertainty. Using components as a consumer early on the development process helps avoid uncertainty and achieve faster and more accurate results. -->
<!-- During this turorial we will walk through building the components below. Keep in mind you can decide to deep dive to each one of the steps and walk
through just the things you care about. -->

## Building the components
<!-- 
Choosing the first component is an important step in the process in building a great component-driven design. When choosing the first component, focus on choosing the most
tangible component, a one you can articulate and use to obtain an most immediate value but build it and assume it to be external. In a component graph,
this is usually a top-level component, like an App, Authentication or if you already have an app and looking to build a new button you need, it might be it! -->

During this tutotial we will walk through building the components below. You can either create a new component, implement it yourself and use our component just as a reference or fork ours as a starting point.

Keep in mind you can record your progress at any time, push components to remote scopes and resume work later! Head over to the [collaborate](#collaborate) section and follow
the step to push your changes to remote scopes at any time!

<!-- Components grow from needs. A need is somewhere you needed a certain component. The more needs, the better a component API gets. -->
