<!-- Choosing the first component is an important step in the process in building a component-driven design. When choosing the first comopnent, focus on choosing the most
tengible component, the one you can ideally use now. When building a component someone else is expected to use, try and agree on a clear API contract early on to minimize
the amount of uncertainty. Using components as a consumer early on the development process helps avoid uncertainty and achieve faster and more accurate results. -->
<!-- During this turotial we will walk through building the components below. Keep in mind you can decide to deep dive to each one of the steps and walk
through just the things you care about. -->

Every component starts from a Need. A need is somewhere you needed a certain component. The more needs, the better a component API gets.

Choosing the first component is an important step in the process in building a great component-driven design. When choosing the first comopnent, focus on choosing the most
tengible component, the one you can ideally use now and obtain immidiate value from:
