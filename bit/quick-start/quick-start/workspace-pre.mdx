## Create workspace
<!-- 
The first step in the Bit journey is to initiate a [Bit workspace](/workspaces). You can use the Bit workspace to either create, use or import components,
make changes to them, and export these changes back. Workspaces are tech-agnonstic and allow development of components of all kinds. They can be used by a single developer
maintaining few components for a certain scope of work and exist on top of existing repositories or shared as a [Workspace component](/workspace/workspace-component). -->
The first step in the Bit journey is to initiate a new [Bit workspace](/workspaces).

Bit workspaces provide a structured environment for a variety of developer tasks. You can create new components, use existing components, modify existing components, and export new and existing components - all from the same workspace. They also allow for the development of all types of components.

Bit Workspaces are tech agnostic, and are designed to fit into your existing tech stack. Workspaces are designed to be scaleable. So whether you’re a solo developer working with a few components, or you’re a team of a hundred developers and a thousand components, a Workspace will provide the same level of experience.

:::tip
It is recommended to [create a bit.cloud account](https://bit.cloud/signup) prior to creating the workspace to ensure the right owner name for your components.
You can choose to host the Bit yourself, choose a name for the remote scope in which the component you be hosted.
