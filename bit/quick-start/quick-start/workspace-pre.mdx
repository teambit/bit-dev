## Create workspace

<!--
The first step in the Bit journey is to initiate a [Bit workspace](/workspaces). You can use the Bit workspace to either create, use or import components,
make changes to them, and export these changes back. Workspaces are tech-agnonstic and allow development of components of all kinds. They can be used by a single developer
maintaining few components for a certain scope of work and exist on top of existing repositories or shared as a [Workspace component](/workspace/workspace-component). -->

The first step in the Bit journey is to initiate a new [Bit workspace](/workspaces). It is a development workspace for distributed, component-driven software. You can create new components, use and modify existing components, and export your changes. 

- **Distributed.** Developers can pull the specific components they need to work on from any project, whether it is a repo, monorepo or a new Bit workspace.
- **Scalable.** Scale from one to hundreds of components in a single workspace. Distribute to more worksapces as more people get involved for your codebases to stay small
and easy to maintain.
- **Tech agnostic.** Designed to fit your tech needs - for example, React, Node and Angular components can be built and used in the same workspace.

<!-- Bit Workspaces are tech agnostic, and are designed to fit into your existing tech stack. Workspaces allow to distribute development into components  -->

<!-- 
Workspaces are design to preserve smooth and scalable dev experience. You can start as a solo developer building few components, or grow to a team of developers
collaborating on components in different workspaces together. -->

<!-- Workspaces are designed to be scalable.
So whether you’re a solo developer working with a few components, or you’re a team of a hundred developers and a thousand components, a Workspace will provide the same level of experience. -->

<!-- :::tip
It is recommended to [create a bit.cloud account](https://bit.cloud/signup) prior to creating the workspace to ensure the right owner name for your components.
You can choose to host the Bit yourself, choose a name for the remote scope in which the component you be hosted.
