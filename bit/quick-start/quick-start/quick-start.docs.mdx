description: A QuickStart component to use for creating QuickStarts .

import { QuickStart } from './quick-start';

<!-- #### What is 'Quick Start' -->

'Quick Start' is a simple tutorial, that shows how to solve a specific problem in a composable way.

Here are a few examples:

1. [Analytics-Quick-Start](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start/analytics) - Composable analytics dashboard.
2. [Design-System-Quick-Start](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start/design) - Composable design system.
3. [Wiki-Quick-Start](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start) - Composable wiki.
   <!--
   explaining to new Bit users how to install Bit, create their first workspace, collaborate with Bit and build a specific component.
   The 'Quick Start' component already has the installation guide etc., and -->
   <!--
   you need to add the explanation of how to **build a specific component**.
   We call this the _'mainComponent'_, and this example component is meant to explain a specific subject in Bit. -->

In order to create your own quick start, first you need to create and export the _'mainComponent'_. this is the component that you will be teaching the readers how to bulid in your 'Quick Start'.
Keep it simple and try to demonstrate how to solve one specific problem in a composable way with Bit.
Here are some _'mainComponent'_ examples: [Design-System-_mainComponent_](https://bit.cloud/teambit/design/examples/sample-app?version=0.0.9), [Analytics-_mainComponent_](https://bit.cloud/teambit/analytics/examples/dashboard/~compositions?version=0.0.1)

#### 'Quick Start' id

The id for the 'Quick Start' you build should be:

```js
@teambit/your-scope/quick-start/your-quick-start-name
```

Like this for example: [teambit/bit/quick-start/wiki-quick-start](https://bit.cloud/teambit/bit/quick-start/wiki-quick-start)

#### Building your 'Quick Start'

Now that you have the _'mainComponent'_ we can get started with creating the 'Quick Start'!

1. Add custom text - you can add all or some of these, the aim is to explain the benefits of composable architecture:

- _' intro '_- (there is a default intro if you don't add this text yourself).
- _' ending '_ - after the component showcase.
- _' before-thinking '_ - before the component breakdown.

2. Add the _'components'_ - the component breakdown - a list of components that compose the _'mainComponent'_ (recommended to have 3 to 6 components, so it doesn't get too crowded).

3. Add an explanation before each of the components - what is their responsibility and functionality.
   This part gets added inside the _'components'_ array in this way:

```js
const components = [
  {
    id: 'teambit.design/examples/sample-app',
    intro: <div>Add text about this component here</div>,
  },
  {
    id: 'teambit.design/ui/heading',
    intro: <div>Add text about this component here</div>,
  },
];
```

### Using the 'Quick Start' component:

```js
// Add all of your text as a string, an element or import it from an mdx file.
const components = [
  {
    id: 'teambit.design/examples/sample-app',
    intro: <div>Add intro text here</div>,
  },
  {
    id: 'teambit.design/ui/heading',
    intro: <div>Add intro text here</div>,
  },
];

const id = ComponentID.fromString('teambit.design/examples/sample-app');

<QuickStart
  // Add all of your text as a string, an element or an mdx file.
  intro={'Add your introduction here'}
  ending={'Add your text after the component showcase'}
  beforeThinking={'Add text before the component breakdown'}
  name="name-of-your-quick-start"
  // id and main Component - The component you are teaching people to build. This will appear in the component showcase
  // at the top of the quick start, and this is usually also the first component in the
  // component-thinking-process (The breakdown of the components in the tutorial):
  id={id}
  mainComponent={<SampleApp />}
  // The components in the component breakdown at the end of the tutorial
  components={components}
/>;
```
