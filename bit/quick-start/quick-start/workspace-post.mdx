Start the Workspace UI console:

```bash
bit start
```

:::tip
It is recommended to open an editor like VSCode on the workspace to start editing the components source code. To learn more on [editor setup head here](/getting-started/installing-bit/editor-setup).

Bit was designed for gradual adoption and has a minimal footprint. You can start small with one component, or build scale to build component-driven project; the choice is yours, and Bit has no preference.

<!-- Bit will also work alongside the development tools and technologies you already use, so you can continue to use the tech stack you know and love, and add Bit into the mix. -->

To get started, you will want to create a new Bit workspace. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a new workspace. [To start from an existing project head here.](/getting-started/installing-bit/add-to-existing-project)

Bit was designed for gradual adoption and has a minimal footprint. Since components are isolated, Bit can easily co-exist next to other development tools,
across different projects. This tutorial demonstrates creating a new workspace, to [start from an existing project head here](/getting-started/installing-bit/add-to-existing-project).
