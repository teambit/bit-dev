## Components

A component as an **independent, reusable product with an interface for using it**. You design the component interface for your own needs,
and iterate over time to increase support for needs as they come. Every component could serves you, teammates, fellow product teams, or even open source it for the use of
entire world.

Components are described by names and APIs, and contain source code implementation. They can be of different kinds like apps, pages, UI components, backend services and even content.
You can think of almost anything in components.
