## Components

A component is an **independent, reusable product that provides an interface for using it**. You begin by designing the component interface to suit 
your own needs, iterating over time to increase support for new needs as they come.  Design every component to serve your needs, then iterate and grow others needs, fellow product teams, 
or even the entire world.

Components are described by names and APIs, and contain source code implementation. They can be of different kinds like apps, pages, UI components, backend services and even content.
You can [think of almost anything in components](/thinking-in-components).
