Building a Wiki in components means you get a better product while making it easier to collaborate and contribute. In fact, you can
add any feature or functionality to your Wiki by simply adding or extending components.
And what makes this really easy is that each team can create, maintain and own the content that is relevant to them, independently! Making building and maintaining a wiki a lot easier.
